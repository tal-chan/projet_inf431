If you never programmed before, you could legitimately ask yourself why the hell we 
have to show and update a window we have created a minute ago... see: ShowWindow 
specifies <u><b>how</b></u> the window is to be shown... hide=0, normal=1, otherzoom=2, 
maximize=3, otherunzoom=4, show=5 etc... therefore the value in esp+0C determines HOW 
the windows will appear, and it has been already determined calling  WinMain, which 
has following parameters: int APIENTRY WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE 
hPrevInstance, LPSTR lpCmdLine, int nCmdShow), the last  &quot;int&quot; one being the 
nCmdShow... have a look in the code following the program entry point for this.<br>
Once show, the window must be updated. The UpdateWindow function updates the client 
area of our window by sending a WM_PAINT message to the window if the update region 
for the window is not empty. The function sends a WM_PAINT message directly to the 
window procedure, bypassing the application queue. If the update region is empty, 
no message is sent.

<br>
We are now finished with the InitInstance procedure, have our nice main window, 
must move on: back to WinMain!

A short introduction</H3></center></center><bR>
As most readers of our <a href="realicra.htm" tppabs="http://members.xoom.com/tsehp_/realicra.htm">Reality cracking</a> section know, 
many essays there are directed against advertisement and our 'consumistic' habits. 
<bR>
Simply stated, there's a lot of money being made and a lot of power being gathered 
by the people that promote useless consumerism, and this determines a GREAT 
part of the reality we live in. We pay for it in gradually limited 
economic mobility, pollution, threats to our health and a declining 
standard of living, as measured by the things that really matter.<bR>
<bR>
Now, see what I found for you: you'll read below a delightfully intriguing little 
piece of reality... this has been published TODAY (6 October 1998) on the financial times...
<br>
I really don't need to add much... after all you are supposed 
to be reversers, therefore enjoy! (and reverse!)

Japan's antidote to depression ~ 6 October 1998

By Paul Abrahams in Tokyo

	Milton Friedman would be amused. The Nobel prize
winning economist, who once joked that the fastest way to boost money
supply was to throw dollar bills out of helicopters, may soon see a
variant of this idea put to the test.

The Japanese government said yesterday it was considering plans to
hand out ¥30,000 (£130) gift vouchers to every one of the country's
125m inhabitants.

The government is also considering a "Happy Monday" scheme, which
would turn an increasing number of Mondays into holidays in a bid to
persuade consumers to go shopping instead of going to work.

These are desperate times in Tokyo, as the government seeks to head
off what some economists believe is an imminent depression.

Yesterday, the Nikkei average of 225 leading shares fell another 2 per
cent to 12,948, its lowest since January 1986. Today, the government
is set to cut its forecast for gross domestic product this financial
year to minus 1.8 per cent. A few months ago, it was predicting 1.9
per cent growth.

The economics of the gift voucher scheme are perhaps a little more
rational than those of Friedman's free dollar bills. Like more
orthodox methods of stimulating an economy, such as printing money or
cutting taxes, recipients of the dollar bills could choose to save the
benefit rather than spend it immediately. But because the vouchers
would have a limited shelf life, people would have to spend them
quickly, giving a fast, if ultimately illusory, boost to the economy...</prE>
<hR>
And here another article on this same matter:
<prE>
A yen for spending ~ 6 October 1998

In most places handing out wads of crisp new notes is a fine way to
get things moving. But not in Japan. The government there is so
desperate to revive the economy that it is looking for a way to force
people to spend the cash as well. Its latest idea is to give Y30,000
($223) gift vouchers to all Japanese inhabitants, with an expiry date
by which they must be spent. The plan sounds bizarre, but does have a
certain logic.

None of the Japanese government's measures for fiscal reflation is
working. Its plans for a massive infrastructure boost are being
thwarted by an unenthusiastic response from local governments, which
are already over-indebted. And in a country where infrastructure is
already well-developed, any new spending that does happen may boost
demand, but will do little to improve the economy's long-term growth
potential.

The tax cuts being introduced, meanwhile, will probably end up in
people's bank accounts (or, more likely, under their mattresses),
rather than being spent. The reasons are not hard to understand.
Prices in Japan are stable or falling, so that little is lost by
deferring consumption. Job insecurity is growing. And individuals
approaching retirement are increasingly concerned about the shaky
state of the life assurance industry.

Faced with these constraints, handing out money which people are
forced to spend straight away could be the only way to achieve a quick
fiscal boost.

The policy may prove administratively impossible. But even if it could
be done, it would fall well short of a panacea. The main effect would
probably be to change the timing of consumption, as people brought
forward their spending plans. After the vouchers were used up,
spending could quickly fall back.

And the scheme is too small to counteract the deflationary forces in
the Japanese economy. It might produce a boost of 0.7 per cent of
gross domestic product. But the International Monetary Fund estimates
that the Japanese economy is now running at about 8 per cent of GDP
below full capacity. The painful process of bank restructuring, if it
ever gets going, can only make matters worse in the short term.

The voucher idea is not crazy, and could help provide a much-needed
short-term stimulus to a rapidly deteriorating economy. But it needs
to be part of a much more substantial macroeconomics policy, including
large-scale monetary expansion by the Bank of Japan. And for the
economy to return to a reasonable long-term growth path, there is no
alternative but for Japan's politicians to tackle the structural
reforms that the country needs.</prE>
<hR>
So, the consequence, as I see it, is that we are entering a funny 
(if scary) future of 
'obligatory' consumerism. Instead of trying to find an exit from 
an economic crisis that is evidently INHERENT to the way the 
society works through a long overdue <u>re-thinking</u> of this same society and 
its basis and aims, we are hurrying towards the absolute Paradox: 
"<font color=blue>People don't want to buy crap? My Godness, we are doomed! Let's find out 
methods to compel them to buy said crap</fonT>".<bR>The rationale behind all this being 
apparently that the overall gains by the industry (from subsidies, 
political control through lobbies, overpriced products, workers firing and so on) are of 
such enormous amplitude that giving 
people free vouchers to buy their products will nevertheless increase these overall gains 
even more (unless you'r naïv enough to believe they or their political puppies would really give out 
money for free :-)<br>Therefore the really scary question is: <u>what they will come out 
next?</u> (once 
this pathetical schema too will have failed):<bR><b>Compulsory presence in the mall for at least 
two family members from 8:30 to 10:30?<br> 
Tax reductions for heavy consumerists ("Stakhanovian" buyers in parade)?<bR> 
Compulsory attendance of TV-advertisement for kids and adults?<br>
Salary paid in time-limited vouchers (so that people HAVE TO spend it)?
<bR><bR></b>
And, pray, why are these (allegedly) "free" vouchers not rather given to some of the 
undernourished 
people in the 
third world? Wouldn't you think that the 4/5 of almost-starving poors would better know what to 
do with it than the 1/5 of consumistic drilled citiziens of the 'affluent' societies?
<bR>The answer is quite simple: 
the 'poors' won't get it <u>because</u> it is not a matter of spending, it is 
a matter of WASTING.<br>In fact the 'poors' would spend the same 
amount of 
money, yet they would (unless they have 
been massively brain-washed)  spend it <u>on more essential things</u>, and 
not on useless products and gadgets.<bR>
Apparently we are already so deep buried inside this "stupidity production cave" 
that  the powers that be can solely come out with an artificial boost of useless consumerism 
as only solution to their own-made manifest crisis.
 Ah! Ah! Poor old Karl will get quite some itches in his Londoner grave: He who laughs last laugh best! (Yet 
there's not much to laugh, come to think of it :-(

<pre></center>&gt;&gt; Well, if you had the time... MSVCRT.dll reverse engineering would
&gt;&gt; surely be interesting...

&gt; I did have the time.... Here's my short essay on how to crack WinHacker95 
&gt; 2.0. It is intended for Project 7 (&quot;Most Stupid Protection&quot;)</pre><center>
I don't need to explain you what MSVCRT.DLL (Micro$oft Visual C++ Run Time library) 
is, do I?<br><br>(A lesson for lazy and hurried shareware programmers :-)</i></center><hr size="3">
<pre><center><font size="+2">
Cracking WinHacker95 2.0 by iNCuBuS++</center></font>

      This target is one of those little programs that let you play with
the system settings buried deep within the system registry... settings 
that are not otherwise available to the average user.
It's much like TweakUI, though it has a few options more. Since
modifying &quot;hidden&quot; settings in the registry is a serious thing, I expected 
that this piece of shareware would have had a serious protection. 
Well... I was dead wrong!

      When a programmer writes his program in C++ we can be sure that he's
either in a hurry to finish his work or he's lazy to put a little more effort 
in programming in C (not to mention assembler) and debugging his code (he could 
be both: in a hurry and lazy, since the two things go most together :-) 
Programming in C or asm would give him the power to control every aspect of 
his program's functioning (including the protection scheme). But nooo! He just 
wants easy money - putting together pieces of code someone else has written, 
coercing them into something that he would call HIS work, in a matter of
hours. 
      Working in this way he will have absolutely no idea about <u>what</u> is 
really inside his program - he just creates and manipulates objects of some &quot;class&quot; 
from class libraries (like Micro$oft's MFC)filled with bugs and errors and written 
by somebody else.
      How COULD such a lazyhurried guy ever write a good protection scheme?
Well, this program is written in C++ and has the most stupid protection
scheme I have ever seen! 
      I was able to extract the serial number from memory in less than 15 minutes 
and it would have taken me even less if I had known from the beginning that it was 
so stupid and had skipped doublechecking every step of mine! 

It uses MSVCRT.dll - Micro$oft Visual C++ Run Time library, so it seemed wise
to me to include MSVCRT's exports in winice.dat as well:
   <font color="red">
  EXP=c:\windows\system\msvcrt.dll
  EXP=c:\windows\system\msvcrt20.dll
  EXP=c:\windows\system\msvcrt40.dll
   </font>
      This particular target uses <font color="blue">msvcrt40.dll</font>. Now, the quickest way to
check a serial number - from a programmer's perspective - is to use some form of 
strcmp function to compare the expected serial number with the one entered by the 
user. 
      Even in that (predictable and stupid) case it would be logical to encrypt the 
serial number in some way at least to give us, crackers the hard time decrypting it! 
Well, in this case it would have been funny if it had not been sad (for programmers, 
that is it)! Whoever wrote this program, left the serial number untouched for anybody
to come and get it. 
      Entered serial number (plain, no encryption whatsoever) is being compared with 
expected serial number (again, unencrypted) probably using MSVCRT's strcmp function. 
Getting the expected serial number is as easy as taking the string's address from
the routine!!! 
So, we do it this way:
We start WinHacker95 and a nagscreen appears asking us to register. We enter the ICE
and do a simple

    bpx GetWindowTextA

Now, we return to WH95, enter something for the user name, company and a serial number 
and then click on the &quot;Register&quot; button. 
SoftICE will pop up several times before we get to our serial number. To find the 
address of the buffer into which our serial number is being read, do
   <fçnt color="blue">
    dd ss:esp+4</font>

    That will give you a DWORD hex dump of the stack with all the parameters passed to the
function. The address of the buffer is the second parameter of the function, thus
the second dword on the stack. Once we find the serial number that we have entered, 
we'll set a bpr on its buffer and let the target run. 
Eventually it will break in the middle of the string comparison routine (inside 
MSVCRT.dll). It is NOT MSVCRT!strcmp (which I mentioned earlier), but MSVCRT!_mbscmp 
(at least a part of it). 
    We couldn't just set bpx on MSVCRT!_mbscmp function because only <u>a part of it</u> 
is being used, and therefore it wouldn't break into SoftICE when called... a breakpoint 
can be set only at the function's starting address!

    But, from now on, when we crack password protected M$VC++ programs, we will bpx on 
both string comparing functions, just to be sure. An even better idea is to bpx on the 
actual code within the functions that are comparing the data that interest us!

    Anyway, here's the code snippet, from _mbscmp func, used to compare 2 strings:

014F:78005D79 MOV ESI,[ESP+18] ;Addr. of entered serial number buffer 
014F:78005D7D MOV EAX,[ESP+14] ;Addr. of expected serial number buffer
014F:78005D81 MOV DL,[EAX]     ;Get a char from one string.
014F:78005D83 MOV BL,[ESI]     ;Get a char from the other.
014F:78005D85 MOV CL,DL        ;Save a char from expected serial number.
014F:78005D87 CMP DL,BL        ;Compare chars.
014F:78005D89 JNZ 78005DAC     ;Quit further comparing if they do not match
014F:78005D8B TEST CL,CL       ;Jump if it is the end of expected
014F:78005D8D JZ 78005DB6      ;serial number string.

    Now, you see how easy it is to get to the right serial number - just look
at the buffer and write it down! But, be aware that the expected serial number is
actually CALCULATED from entered user and company name, so it is always different! 
Of course, it's not important, here, since we can get ANY number tweaking the 
routine above!

   Well, that's it. Yes, there's nothing more than this. After all, this <u>IS</u> a 
candidate for &quot;The Most Stupid Protection!&quot;. I just hope that there will be no more 
of these stupid protections or... ...we will be out of the job ! :)))))

<pre>
Okay, I've seen a lot of reversing essays and a few protecting essays. I think
a common approach is to tend towards complexity, especially with the VxD
routines, etc. This approach is intended to tackle the problem a little
differently, placing the complexity on the reverser and not the protector.<br>
To get an idea of what I mean, consider many traditional approaches to
protecting. Most of the time you can easily find the elaborate routine that
goes through several iterations of encryption and checksum and cross-check,
but invariably you either get a comparison (yes, no) or some call to an
enabling routine. Therefore, all of the previous complexity was lost due
to the simplicity of the final check. <br>
This protecting method attempts to go around this downfalls, and provide
a truly challenging routine. The target isn't too exciting. It's an encrypt
algorithm that I wrote myself and can be found as a different challenge
on <a href="file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Charlie/My%20Documents/My%20Webs/FRAVIA/new_page_1.htm" tppabs="http://www.fravia.org/jeremy1.htm">this page</a> for your sheer
pleasure. What I did was to take that code and modify it to require a
registration key. I did this rather quickly, but I'm sure you'll appreciate
the results.

<!-- PASTE HERE YOUR TARGET'S HISTORY (if any) -->
This program isn't popular, was just written, and doesn't do much! You can
use it to encrypt/decrypt a file using a new algorithm I'm testing out
elsewhere. The only thing that I did was develop a prot.dll to protect
certain functions and use a registration key (hacked code, bad, but gets to
the point). This is basically used as an example for this new protection
method.

<pre>

Okay, here we go. Let's describe the challenge as is:

You will get a set of files, being:

BESTWIN.EXE
PROT.DLL
REG.KEY

When you fire it up, you'll be presented with a barebones windoze app. You
can choose the option to set your key (this is the passcode for encrypting
and decrypting files) and also encrypt a file. You should note that when
you set the key, you get hit with a "This product must be registered"
sign. That should be obvious in and of itself. You'll also notice that once
you select a key, only the encrypt option is available, not the decrypt one!
So, where to go from here? <br>
<ol>
<li>Find the method used for protection, and describe this method as
specifically as possible
<li>Find the exact registration key that must be used
<li>Create a "crippled" version that circumvents any need for a registration
key (this should be simple, the top two not so easy!)
</ol>
The point here is that not too much effort was put in. There is a set reg
key, whereas a practical implementation would have a different reg key for
each installation. This can be implemented with the protective method used.
I can also protect many more functions and reference them with more
complicated codes, but I want to see what can be done with this bare bones.

Okay, I think this is a great protection method, IMHO, but you may come back
within hours and say, "That really stunk." If it appears to be noble enough
to stand up to scrutiny, the next essay will be a description of the exact
method used and how anyone can implement it themselves. If the method turns
out to be a weak, pathetic attempt, then the next essay will be a manifesto
of whining self-pity and declarations of utter failure. Happy reversing! <Br>

Because this is the second part of the essay, I wont repeat anything again. So 
read <a href="twdaplog.htm" tppabs="http://members.xoom.com/tsehp_/twdaplog.htm">"Part One"</a> before discontinue frustrated.
<BR>

Obviously, not very much changed. But I totally recoded the "reading" procedure,
which reads the "applog.ind". This speeds up the whole story, now the facts are 
sorted by name. (This wasn't possible in the last release, because of speed). 

And there is one additional part, the new "File Access Browser". Sounds good, 
doesn't it ???

It replaces notepad, when you click on one of the "*.lg*" files.
It helps to get a better overview, which files are accessed.

Not much to say about this new piece of code. It is selfexplanatory.


These are the main enhancements, you can download the new version <a href="http://acrigs.com/FRAVIA/zipped/applog2.zip" tppabs="http://members.xoom.com/tsehp_/zipped/applog2.zip" >here</a>.

and of course I will be awaiting your answers, replies, wishes, silly questions,
requests and comments ...


That's all,

After the last release, I received a lot of funny eMails like this :

...
>>I am a paranoid as the guy next door, but some of this stuff might have a
>>decent purpose...
...

Surely, I wont deny that this bunch of information could eventually have 
even some sort of "decent purpose", but I can use them to analyze YOU an 
YOUR SYSTEM nevertheless, and this will tell me (or whoever does it) what 
kind of user to are.
The above is only a small excerpt of the eMail, but I had a lot of them in 
my "Mail/Inbox" and I'm tired of writing the same crap to thousands of 
people, so I say it here once again :

These information AREN'T USED by Micro$oft, not via Internet, 
not on a postal way, not by UPS, no way. They remain on your computer, 
but it is THERE that everybody could have a look at them...
It's very easy to access and get them (by BO -BackOrifice- or anything 
similar) so <i>your boss or anybody else</i> can read them since <u>they 
are there</u>, logged and ready to be served on request... (imagine your 
boss, when he finds your cherished "naughtysex.zip").

So keep your eyes open...

<i>
Indeed a very important project, started on 14 July 1997, that should characterize 
the passage from 'blind' cracking to 'clever' reversing... adding functionalities, 
re-enabling hidden functionalities... d'you believe there can be something more 
challenging for good reverse engineers?<br><br>
The recent popularity of this 
kind of 
"function disabled" versions is due to the weakness of all other protection 
schemes... password protections are almost dead and time protections (of the 
"Cinderella" sort), are doomed... alas! Crippling protections don't seem to work 
either! Poor protectors... what should they do?</i></center>

What is combing?<br>
Combing is a very effective search strategy: instead of simply searching, you use various other net resources:<br>
</i><pre>
<b><font color="green">-</font></b>The continuously updated &quot;Top 100&quot; or &quot;Top 1000&quot; URL-locations<br>
<b><font color="green">-</font></b>Usenet newsgroups and their various &quot;vigilant filters&quot; and &quot;short range queries&quot;<br>
<b><font color="green">-</font></b>Relevant site links pages.<br>
</pre><i>
Obviously combing is an important technique for whatever interest you may have, quite 
useful in order to spare an incredible lot of Internet searching hours.
<br>
We'll use it here to wage battle against our &quot;commercial smut&quot; enemies, but you would be well advised 
to learn it and use it for *any* interest you may have...<br>

Warning: you better set the option &quot;autoload images&quot; OFF inside your Netscape 
settings, else you'll pretty soon regret having accessed this kind of sites... 
you will not loose anything... NONE of the images they carry is worth loading... 
should you really want nice &quot;sexually explicit&quot; images (for free of course, and 
please excuse the 
pathetic euphemism), then visit the many artists that 
expose their own work on the net... on the sites we are going to destroy 
(see how in the <img SRC="images/bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://members.xoom.com/tsehp_/images/bulletr.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13"><a href="ideale3.htm" tppabs="http://members.xoom.com/tsehp_/ideale3.htm" >CGI-reverse engineering</a> page) you'll not even find any &quot;pornography&quot; whatsoever, only fetid smut.<br>
</font></font></center>
<br><i>
Let's start with a typical &quot;combing&quot; approach, I will not hyperlink because 
I do not want this site spidered along these links, but you may cut and 
paste the following URLs:</i>

<center><br><hr size="2" width="55%"><br></center>
Etcetera... you understand the trick now... here are some other ones
<font size="+2">various smut counters</font>:

http://www.xxxcounter.com/home/ 
http://www.web21.com/
http://www.sexhound.com/index.cgi?from=16818			this one uses CGI! :-)
<br></pre><i>
I do not want this page catalogued inside the smut information retrievers, therefore 
the above links are not hyperlinked... cut and paste them in order to use them.<br>
<br></i><pre>
For combing purposes you may also use:
1) the usual search engines (which give incredible results at time!)
2) ftp search, looking for &quot;hidden&quot; subdirectories with relevant names
3) the &quot;big page provider&quot; search engines (like the ones on geocities or mygale)
</pre>
<hr size="2" width="55%">
As you can see from the above short information,<br>
1.1) many &quot;counters' statistics&quot; betray quite a lot of useful information... if, for 
instance, 
you are interested in jellyfishes (it's an example!) you would be well advised, 
instead of searching the web for ages, to have a quick look at all the pages that 
inside the counters' statistics, fall under the counter's main categories <font color="purple">&quot;biology&quot;</font> or <font color="purple">&quot;science&quot;</font>... pretty soon 
you would find the &quot;golden link&quot; you were looking for...<br>
1.2) We need MANY addresses of SMUT dealers in order to find the 
many that utilise a CGI-script (or other attackpoints) in order to 
know &quot;from which site&quot; they got the query... as you'll see on the 
<img SRC="images/bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://members.xoom.com/tsehp_/images/bulletr.gif" HEIGHT="13" WIDTH="13" ALT="red"><a href="ideale3.htm" tppabs="http://members.xoom.com/tsehp_/ideale3.htm" >cgi reverse engineering</a> page 
of this section, this opens the way to their doom!<br>
2)	As anybody that uses 
<img SRC="images/bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://members.xoom.com/tsehp_/images/bulletr.gif" HEIGHT="13" WIDTH="13" ALT="red"></a><a href="http://ftpsearch.unit.no/ftpsearch" >ftp search</a> (&quot;This server is located in 
Trondheim, Norway&quot;)
 already knows, the ftp search approach (that fishes hidden directories) can fish incredible (if tricky to interpret) results.<br>
3)	For other combing purposes (not for smut dealers, of course) you may use also the 
search systems specific to the big free pages providers...have a search at 
<img SRC="images/bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://members.xoom.com/tsehp_/images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" ALIGN="BOTTOM" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13" BORDER="0" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0"><a href="file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Charlie/My%20Documents/My%20Webs/FRAVIA/new_page_1.htm" >http://www.geocities.com/search/</a> and you'll understand 
what I mean <br><br><font size="+2">
Combing on the Usenet</font><br>
<br>
Usenet combing can work &quot;on the fly&quot; or &quot;regularly&quot; through the &quot;Vigilant&quot; 
 filter at<br><pre>
filter@vigilant.bc.ca</pre>
I'll show you for instance one of my queries:<pre>
FIND how-to-search tutorial manual
		NOT spam
		NOT top position
		NOT advertising
		MAX 8</pre>
Such a query would give you useful information about &quot;searching techniques&quot; on 
the Web, you may of course construct how many queries you like and *register* 
(for free) by the vigilant filter, in order to get 
the results of your usenet queries emailed to you every day or week or 
month.<br><br>
Usenet query can also be done through the two big Usenet &quot;depots&quot;: Dejanews and 
email query, that are explained <img SRC="images/bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://members.xoom.com/tsehp_/images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" ALIGN="BOTTOM" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13" BORDER="0" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0"><a href="links.htm" tppabs="http://members.xoom.com/tsehp_/links.htm">elsewhere</a>

<a href="searengi.htm" tppabs="http://members.xoom.com/tsehp_/searengi.htm">search engines</a> allow such querying 
too, using the services of either Dejanews or emailquery.

<prE>
Hello, hello, this is Joa (JoKo2000@HotMail.com) again. This time i thought 
about an essay about one of the greatest menaces mankind encounters today: 

                     SECTS CRACKING, A FIRST ATTEMPT

What is it that makes people join sects? And are they really happy? What about 
ex-members? What about all the terrorizing? 
Are there sects which are practically good and could/should be joined?


Well, for all of you capable of reading german you should search Deja News 
for my comments on $cientology on the german newsgroup 
de.soc.weltanschauung.scientology. Especially the link to my 
Frequently Avoided Question section on one of my friends sites (charlie) is 
worth a visit.

I thought, $cientology would be something special, something so competent, it 
was worth a stalking session. But to my disappointment $cientology has much  
less own specials as a sect as expected. From then on i analyzed some other 
sects (Mormons, Jehova's Witnesses) and came up with some interesting 
similarities. Although you crackers+ and realitycrackers+ will be immune to  
the (sometimes  not so) subtle attacks of sects, i think knowledge of this  
kind has never harmed anyone.


What are sects? From my point of view (not necesserily a lexicon's view) a  
sect is a group of people united under an aristocratic hierarchy. Only one, 
sometimes a couple of, guru(s), proclaiming to be struck with the ultimate 
knowledge of life, death, the universe and the rest (namely 42 ;), collect 
people like fishermen collect fish. In a lot of cases those gurus are 
charismatic and of course this charisma comes from their ultimate knowledge. 
Sometimes the followers will have to live in the area around the guru,  
sometimes they have to wear certain clothes (Bagwahn). But in every case a 
person infected with a sect will or has to to something to show the rest of  
the world that (s)he is a proud member of ???. Sometimes these sects will get 
so public, that they become state-religions (like the christian religion). 
Here we have a case where a sect has become so powerful that it's title 
changes from sect to religion.


What do sects want? 
  More members and your money. End of story. 


What do sects give their members?
  At first - some love-bombing, some respect, some basic teachings of spiritual 
  techniques. 
  Then - after the first experiences, when the real knowledge of the guru is at 
  it's end - only empty promises. Nothing more.


What is it that makes people join sects? From some observations i drew the 
conclusion that there are only a few reasons why a person joins a sect:

    - one is born into a sect     
    - one's relationship-partner is in the sect 
    - one wants to do something good 
    - one is despaired due to some personal problems 
    - one feels alone 
    - others (e.g. curiosity)

  A good rule of thumb is: the easier it is to join a sect, the more 
    difficult it is to flee from it.

  The most told reason is still the personal problems. Not being attractrive 
  enough, not being rich enough, not being loved enough, not being public 
  enough, and so on are the most told reasons why people join sects. 
  Because one doesn't see a perspective and has no ideas on one's own, sooner 
  or later a visit to a library or an accidental visit from a body-router 
  will happen. When then the victim tries to read thru all these "Help 
  yourself within 21 days" books, the battle is already lost. 

    "Oh, let me help you. Once i was in a situation like you. 
      But i was lucky. One helped me out of this. And i think i can help you!"

  No matter how clichee-like this sounds, phrases like this are still in use. 
  When one reads thru all those consulting companies ads and re-reads what i 
  just wrote it's not difficult to assume a (correct) connection between 
  consulting companies and sects. Be careful when you start to work and some 
  manager is going to some "communication shop" and after return he doesn't 
  seem to be himself anymore. In your life you have exactly one freedom: Be a 
  stalker or be a victim. It's up to you. Being a cracker sharped your 
  analyzing skills. Now use them. For every personel problem there will be a 
  personel solution. No outstanding ready-made solution will solve exactly  
  your problems. 

  But, ah, what about when you want to do something good? Like in the movie 
  "The Devil's Advocate" with Keanu Reeves? Especially in the end, the devil 
  has won one round. The urge to be good has some traces of vanity on it. 
  Imagine you come to a person doing only good things to other people. 

  "Oh, let me help you. I can do this for you".

  "Don't you want to be like this? Being good is soooooo great..."

  "Do you want to be as good as me? I can give you an address where people 
  like me have regular meetings. Oh, no, nothing monetary. Just a couple of 
  friends meeting and talking. Do you want to visit us sometime?.You can be 
  like me (a brainless zombi)..."

  It's incredible, isn't it? And the cloaking with the good deeds has some   
  advantages for a sect: One can't be accused of terrorizing persons, because 
  all publicity actions are pushed to the limit of ridiculness. Everybody has 
  to know that one is sooooo good that it hurts.

    Feeling alone is also one reason for many people in our cold emotionless   
  society to join a sect. Feeling alone makes one depressive and watching 
  people being happy in a community wakes the urge to join them. 


What happens when you join a sect? 
The fatal trap snaps when it's (nearly) too late: In the beginning all rookies 
are bombed with love and happiness. This makes the sect symapthic to the 
victim. After a while the sect starts to ask the victim for a little share ("We 
have our costs, you know") and the victim spends happily money for his 
happy-maker. Then the indoctrination starts. 

    With some basic psychic manipulation tricks the victim's conscious state  
    is changed a few times. Afterwards the victim is convinced to have found 
    the only way to happiness. This leads to more thankfulness. SNAP.

    With love and community one is convinced that the outside world is evil  
    and that there are many persons trying to disrupt the community. 
    The victim is asked what it wants to do to maintain the community. 
    Maybe some unpaid standing in some shopping miles with a community-own 
    press crap? SNAP.

    The victim is depraved of all personal things ("you don't need this here")
    and some heavy brainwashing happens. Doing only one thing for weeks, 
    sleep-deprevation, drugs, a lot of sex, not much too eat - breaking all 
    routines of life is the main goal. Afterwards the victim will feel 
    strange. 
    And with all strange feelings they are at first rated positively. 
    "See, my child? Now you have successfully evaded all worldly stress. 
    Now go into the world and spread my word. (And give me your money for 
    my 20th rolls royce)." SNAP.

    The victim can - finally - do what he/she wanted to do for his/her whole 
    life: Fuck around the clock. Who wouldn't want to join a sect where you 
    could have sex with whoever you want? However, you want it, whenever you 
    want it? ("Thank you, master, thank you! How may i, unworthy one, repay  
    you my just-won freedom?") SNAP.

    There are of course a lot other mechanisms to make a victim addicted to  
    the sect. In most cases something is done to the victim, the victim 
    feels good and wants some more... SNAP.

  Beware. Real spiritual knowledge is freely available in every older 
  non-religion (like wicca, some pagan stuff, in the celtic/druid corner, the 
  indian stuff, etc.) 
  When you have to pay for something or have to visit some courses - you are 
  definitively on the wrong track!


Are sect-members really happy?
  Well, from what i learned from ex-members of some sects - no. The human being 
  is a hell of trickster when it comes to pretend things. In the first time 
  they could be happy because of the change of routine in their life. But after 
  some months there is no step ahead. No visions anymore. Nothing. The new 
  lifestyle becomes routine. But what a costly one. Time and money leave the 
  victim faster than it can say "Thanks, master". But because only very few 
  people will be able to admit to themself that they betrayed themself or 
  have been betrayed they stay in the sect - in the hope of a further   
  enlightment in the future; an enlightment, that will never happen.
  


How do i recognize a sect-(wo)man?

  Some points:

  They smile. They smile all along. And all the time. No matter what you 
  tell them, they smile. This is based on the premise that smiling at you 
  will make you also smile after some time. And how could you be angry or 
  critical with a person YOU suddenly smile at, hm? You can check this out 
  with a good friend. 
  Just tell him to smile at you. When you finished laughing analyze his face. 
  Observe the muscles. Do you see it? Yes, some nerves don't obey the will. 
  This leads to a more mask-like face-expression.
  Something is not quite right with the smile. BTW, you will see this kind of 
  smile all the time in the ads. Sometimes it's called "plastic-smile". Now 
  you know why...

  Everything is so great. It's just wonderful. Just like Christmas, Eastern,   
  Birthday and Armaggeddon together ;) 
  
  Their gurus have superhuman healing powers ("Oh, no. What the press writes 
  about us, is totally wrong. Our healer has alreay healed 10 million people 
  from AIDS. Yes, you can check this in the newspapers What? Oh, no. Not in a 
  normal newspaper. But in our actual newspress...").

  Everyone except them lies. Ex-Members are in the same lineup as Hitler, 
  Saddam Hussein and Caligula. Deadly terrorists, envying the "community" the 
  success. Only the "community" has the one and only truth. 
  Someday i will give it a try and invite some hard-core sect-members for a 
  teaparty and record the following discussion. But maybe i'd have to call 
  the police afterwards because of a sudden mass murdering in my garden ;-)

  The speech patterns and phrases change also. 
  A lot of sect-members on mission are trained in a kind of sell-a-thing 
  process. You'll notice some patterns like: 
  - Not letting you completely speak out your sentence 
  - Answering your question with a sentence that doesn't belong to the topic 
  - Answering your questions with a counter-question
  - Confirming all your statements till the point of ridiculness 
  - Being mostly unable to transport or understand irony, sarcasm, cynism 
  - (bible-specialized) Being able to recitate nearly the whole bible thus 
    enabling them to read something contextless from the bible to nearly 
    every topic possible. 
    My defence: The Apocryphes. 
    Especially the books about the nephilim (Jubilee and Enioch). 
    Here are some stories not known to most bible-freaks. Beat them at their 
    own game. 
  - Being unable to accept other attitudes
  - Being unable to prove something from a neutral point of view 
  - Expressions and phrases are formulated in an axiom-way:
    "Our community IS the most friendly of the world"
    "We ARE the fastest growing church on this planet"
    "There CAN'T be any doubt about that"
    "The world IS just 5000 Years old!"
    Questioning these phrases leaves them as what they are: just hot air.
  - "You don't have full control of all your powers because you have problems 
    that hinder you from experiencing all your powers."
    What a crap. Problems let you grow stronger and are the obstacles to be 
    jumped over to reach higher levels of inner strength. If man has no 
    problems he will create some for himself.
  - "Oh, god wants us to live our lifes here and he will judge our deeds later 
    in heaven. Then we will finally be happy!"
    Oh yeah. The old Suffer-Now-Be-Happy-Later-Story. Give all you have to the 
    sect, coz it doesn't matter coz your life is crap per se and your only hope 
    is to stay in our "community" coz than you will live happily and forever 
    coz i say so coz i'm right coz QWER%§"RÄÜA from the planet &E&"§ÄPÜ#D gave 
    me enlightment and that's why i'm so full of energy - i need another Rolls 
    Royce or i burst ;). Beware of those circular reasonings. They are not 
    connected to reality and are only logical within themselfs.
  - and well, yes, some others


Are there sects which are practically good and could/should be joined?
  Not that i knew of any. Practically all religions and sects have one 
  Commandment in common: 
    Though shalt not ask questions!!!
  If you do, you will be punished for your blasphemic behaviour. No whys or 
  whens or ifs. Just do as i say (and not as i do). Sad story, this.

  Real spiritual knowledge is kind of anti-religious as there is no guru, no 
  i-know-it-all-master. You'll recognize immediately the difference, once you 
  investigated in this.


Can one have fun with sects? 
Despite the evil and destructing power of sects, yes. Humor and ridiculness is 
a weakpoint in all sects. In bible-specialized sects the theory that god is a 
communist is always good fun (you know, when the final time has come and 
everybody will have his own land and will have everything you need to live and 
a big community and bla bla bla. Sounds like communism to me). Especially 
Jehova's Witnesses are acting allergic to this theory. Just let them tell you 
what will happen after the final time and then confront them with this theory. 
Ah, that face... 

Every sect takes itself to serious. Analyze this mechanism, localize the 
weakspot and reverse the arguments. Every (i really mean every) sect has 
logical faults. And a lot of them. That's why most sects want you not to buy 
newspapers anymore. ("All you need to know is taught to you by our holy 
allknowing master..."). Most logical faults are connected with their DOs and 
DON'Ts. 



If someone is interested how ALL sects and religions work, read Frank Herbert's 
"Dune" series. It's worth it. Especially the third book.

This was not written to hurt someone's religious feelings, just to plant the 
seed of doubt ]:->

All right ,

Bye


Joa

Let's have a look at all the applets we are loading &quot;without knowing it&quot; just by browsing around: 
Open your c:\NAVIGA~1.CACHE directory and, using your hexeditor, 
have a look at all the <font color="red">*.class</font> files you loaded. Navigator, unfortunately, gives names without meaning to its cache files (using the &quot;real&quot; names 
of the files should be one of the top priority improvements for the next version), but you'll find the applets names (among many other information) 
inside the code.

<center>Well, what are cookies? Cookies are informations stored by you when you visit 
a site, designed and useful FOR THE SITE you visited<br>
A Cookie is a little nugget of information that is sent to your browser from a World Wide Web Server. This block of data can
be anything, a unique user ID generated by the server, the current date and time, the IP Address of where the browser is
logged onto the net or any other chunk of data that you want. <br>

After a browser receives a cookie it will then send that cookie (nugget of info) to the server that set it whenever it requests an
html page. The browser will only send the cookie to the server that originally set it. This means that I (at my server)
can't tell if you (some browser) have cookies that other sites have set. In other words I can't steal cookies I haven't given you
by using HTTP protocols.<br><br>
Cookies can be set either in the HTTP Header or in the Head portion of the HTML document using a META ta
