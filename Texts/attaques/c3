g (It's
     described on the main page) the problem with doing it that way is that only netscape supports it.

<pre>
This is the format a CGI script would use to add to the HTTP headers 
a new piece of data which is to be stored by the client
for later retrieval. 

Set-Cookie: NAME=VALUE; expires=DATE;
path=PATH; domain=DOMAIN_NAME; secure
</pre>
<u>expires</u> is an optional attribute. If not specified, the cookie will expire when the user's session ends. <br>
The default value of <u>domain</u> is the host name of the server which generated the cookie response<br>
If a cookie is marked secure, it will only be transmitted if the communications channel with the host is a secure one.
 Currently this means that secure cookies will only be sent to HTTPS (HTTP over SSL) servers. 
 If secure is not specified, a cookie is considered safe to be sent in the clear over unsecured channels. <br>
 When requesting a URL from an HTTP server, the browser will match the URL against all cookies and if any of them match, a
line containing the name/value pairs of all matching cookies will be included in the HTTP request.<br>
Have a look at the cookies you have in <font color="red">c:\windows\cookies</font> and examine them with your hexeditor:
<br>this is the cookie I have set in this page:<br>
access.8.www.geocities.com/Athens/5513/.0.2922787840.29120835.1035370336.29084634.*.
<br>
this is the cookie from Hotbot<br>
ink.IU082A0C432A6086A4F2FE64D40F4973EEF27C97.hotbot.com/.0.3590660096.29294449.682573152.29065138.*.
<br>
this is an interesting cookie from LordSomer:<br>
DemoName.fravia.www.cris.com/~lordsome/.0.2705616768.29067717.1995643264.29067516.*.
<br>
Another one: with last visit informations<br>
lastvisit.Tue%20Aug%2013%2003%3a04%3a22%201996%3a838814433.28818.members.tripod.com/.0.951197440.29087610.937623776.29067494.*.
<br>
and the cookie from Netscape:<br>
NETSCAPE_ID.1000e010,1007abea.netscape.com/.0.617916800.29316075.3185882080.29069520.*.
<br>
and the Microsoft cookie<br>
MC1.ID=d65fe66bea8211cfbceb0000f84a13db.microsoft.com/.0.3590660096.29294449.2359962560.29064890.*.
<br>
If a CGI script wishes to delete a cookie, it can do so by returning a cookie with the same name, and an expires time
     which is in the past. The path and name must match exactly in order for the expiring cookie to replace the valid cookie.
     This requirement makes it difficult for anyone but the originator of a cookie to delete a cookie. <br>
<br>
<center><i>So, once more: basically what happens is this: You visit a page and get as response<br></i>
</center><pre>
Set-Cookie: VISITOR=STUPID; path=/; expires=Wednesday, 09-Nov-99 23:12:40 GMT
</pre>
<center><i>From now on, every time you request a URL in the path &quot;/&quot; of the above server, YOU send following message:</i>
</i></center>
<pre>
Cookie: VISITOR=STUPID
</pre>
<hr><i>
How do you go on from here?<br>
As usual: Beg, Borrow and Steal! A good artist copies, a great artist steals - Picasso
</i><hr>

Did you know that Netscape and MIE create a file that helps web servers keep track of you ? 
<br>
On Macs it is in a file called Magic Cookie, on IBM type CPUs it is in a file called cookies.txt<br>
It isn't really meant to be understood: some of the data is encrypted so it's a little hard to read :-)<br>
This &quot;MagicCookie&quot; file is very useful in some cases, like storing some viewing 
configurations (i.e. with or without frames, etc...), but it can also help the server 
know WHO you are and what you do<br>
Say you go to lycos and lookup some keywords, well lycos can store in the cookie 
file a number that helps it know that you're user ID 238f983298ds8s9df (for example)
and store what you looked for in its database (on the web server, this time). 
Well, let's not be paranoid, but, say Glittering Computers Inc wants to spam some ads,
it could ask lycos to setup a specific gif image on lycos' page only to users who 
lookedup computer related links. (that's a simple example).
<hr><center><i>Have a look at your cookies.txt file!<br>
If you lock the cookies.txt file (<font color="red">c:\NAVIGA~1\cookies.txt</font> on non-Mac machines) this will not stop cookies from working. Cookies will still reside in
memory. It will however make it so the cookies can't be written to the hard drive, it may also cause netscape to bomb when
you quit.
</center></i>
<hr><center><i>
Boy, reverser's page are like russian dolls... have a look at my <img SRC="images/bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://members.xoom.com/tsehp_/images/bulletr.gif" HEIGHT="13" WIDTH="13" ALT="red"></a>
<a href="javaco1.htm" tppabs="http://members.xoom.com/tsehp_/javaco1.htm">other</a> cookies!
</i></center><hr>

When the netscape prompt to accept a cookie appears it often gives the value <font color="red">Apache = nnnnnnn</font> there
are two possible reasons: Apache webservers will automatically set a cookie everytime a person goes there, it's to do
     hit counts &amp; accounting. The other is a bug related to earlier versions of Apache where the cookie string is incorrectly
     terminated resulting in a cookie value that looks like s=2398709123948701.
     there is a patch at Apache's website to fix this. 
<hr>
Where does the cookie go after it is sent back to the server 
and how do you read it is another matter: It doesn't really get sent back to the server. It gets sent to he server when the browser makes a request for a page. So
     you have to serve your page from a CGI which recieves the cookie along with the page request then generates a custom
     page based upon the cookie.
<hr>
<center><i>And let's not forget:</i></center>
Through cookies a browser can be tracked over multiple sites, therefore a 
cookie can be used to &quot;register&quot; that you have been to a site, or group of sites X number of times
<hr>
<center><i>Good news for the war against Micro$oft!</i><br>
(I am currently working on it :-)<br>
Another difference between Navigator and Explorer is in the cookie handling category: If you set a cookie in Netscape that is
     empty it will be empty, In Explorer it will not change e.g. Set-Cookie myCookie=; expires=Wednesday, 09-Nov-99
     23:12:40 GMT... etc. Navigator will say the cookie is &quot;&quot; Explorer will say the cookie is the value that it was set to before
     the above Set-Cookie </center>

<prE>
Hello Reverser+,
To be honest, my IRC experience lasted about 1 day. I never really used it,
multi-user chats are too much a waste of time. 
<hR>
Part 3, adding specialized personal contacts, the ICQ approach.

Although the web is a big resource of information and knowledge, not
EVERYTHING exists on the web. Also when you need information on a specialized 
subject, a question 1 > produces answer 2, and question 2 > produces answer 1,
situation often happens. 

If you're new to the subject, don't exactly know what to look for,
if the subject is too specialized to find a satisfying result, you ask people.

If the knowledge doesn't exist on the web, you find the PERSON on the web,
who has that knowledge. Also when you're lost in an overkill of disorganised 
information that doesn't make sense to you, a chat with someone who is 
specialized in the field, will help orientate and organise your search.

ICQ is a chat program much like IRC, except that you don't join a noisy
channel, with many people talking about one subject, but you have your own 
contact list, who can see you when you are online (if you choose so) and 
you can see them. 

I'll give you an example from yesterday. It's not the most specialized
info you can think of, but it does fine as an example.

I have to buy a new harddisk, and am hesitating wether to buy a 6.4GB hard 
disk which is about the price i want to spend on a new HD, or the 8.4GB 
version which is more expensive. 

I have no experience with video on pc,(i dumped my trident for a mystique 2 
weeks ago) yet i want to use my pc in the future, to burn CD video's. 
Now something tells me that i'm going to need a partition bigger than 2GB
for a 74 minute AVI ;). So first i find out if it's possible to have larger
partitions. 

Search: partition > 2GB. 

I end up with info on Fat32, (3rd hit) telling me that partitions of up to 2 
terrabytes are possible (2000GB).   

Then i wonder what other difficulties i may experience, so i search for:
mpeg2 > CD-video
hmmm. long compression times when using software encoders. A burner which 
supports CD-XA, - yes mine does. A program which allows you to write CD 
video, - no mine doesn't, i need easy cd creator, not pro, which i'm 
using now. Probably a video add on for my mystique. I still have no answer
as to the mpeg2 compression ratio of an AVI and, i think of a new question: 
some satellite channels broadcast standard is mpeg2, is it somehow possible 
to capture that? (remember i'm a complete newbie in this)

To make a long story short(er), my answers lead me to new questions. 
General orientation questions on digital video, and very specialized questions
on aspects of burning a CD-video from your home pc, which very few people
are doing today. 

Two posters of answers to newsgroups of the basic orientation question 
"how do i burn CD-video's" (my keywords mpeg2 and CD-video)(NOTE: which others
had already asked.) , seem knowledgeable on the subject. One of them is a
senior engineer at Philips US, one is a cameraman for a commercial TV station. 

I chose  to contact the cameraman for three reasons:

1) The cameraman knows enough, he knows what i want to know, and will
   confuse me less with things that i do not need to know.
2) The cameraman has his ICQ # in his sig, a question > answer > new question 
   situation can take days with email, it takes minutes in a chat.
3) The cameraman lives 20 minutes from where i live and is around my age.

I added him to my contact list, a valuable contact for my future experiments 
with writing CD-video, no doubt. On ICQ you help eachother out, when the 
cameraman needs some info, on anything, he can call on me. Maybe i can help
him out with audio. 

Now i figured i just need one video contact on my list, because i'm not
going to do that many things with it. But i'm in the music business, so
half my contact list are people in the music business.


If my passionate hobby was "Märklin steam locs", i'd search for:

Marklin > ICQ
 
and started adding people who shared that interest.

If i need just one specialist on Märklin, to tell me where to find this ONE
elusive old steam loc, i'd just add this one specialized person to my
contact list, and ask him. It's not only a faster alternative to searching
yourself in some cases, but an additional feauture. Remember: <font color=blue>if the answers
aren't there, the person with the answers could be</fonT>.

part 4: information management:
using webstyle search techniques offline & password updating. 
(or why you can trash your dbase program...)

There are a couple of tools which make on line and off line information
management a lot faster and easier. There will probably be more, but here
are two i use, as an example. Ofcourse you shouldn't trash your dbase
program, there are a lot more uses for it, but i think you'll be seeing a
lot less of it, after reading this :).

offline:

Textfinder (www.a1soft.com)

Your personal search engine for ASCII text files.

It looks in a dir, and scans all txt files in that dir for your
searchstring. Match string, match all words, match any word.  
Rather than a normal search engine that displays as description the first
lines of the page, it displays the text around the found keywords.

It's uses are many. 

- In combination with HTMASC32 (www.bitenbyte.com/htmasc.htm) which
converts multiple html files to ascii text, and a well known proggie like
teleport pro, you can download an entire website, convert it entirely to
ascii text - with the click of a button, and search it for keywords or
strings. Yet another better and faster way to get what you need from
Reverser's site, than clicking through his links. ;)

(trash your dbase program - reason 1:)
- In combination with proggies like foldercat & advanced disk catalog, or
any other dir to text converting tool, you can make txt file indexes of
your CD's, zips, tapes, HD's, put the indexes all in a dir, and search the
txt files for a keyword (program name, file name, a wildcard) like you
would search the web. Foldercat is better for indexing folders, advanced
disk catalog is better for volumes (C: D: E: etc). Foldercat already allows
a search for its own cat files, including descriptions.

- Just thought of this use: 
A few days ago i looked for an ftp tool that auto indexes an ftp, and saves
as text file. No luck there. What i did find though were a lot of tools
that monitor a list of favourite ftp's, dirs on ftp's and possibly fetch
updated files. (i'm going back to look now :) ). If you tell your contacts
with an ftp to index their ftp regularly (say daily), with a proggie like
foldercat or advanced disk catalog, and put the index.txt file up. You can
set one of these ftp tools (there are many) to autofetch all index.txt
files, and you have your own *updated* ftp search engine.

(trhash your dbase program - reason 2)
- Serials. rather than spending time on maintaining a stupid database of
serials, with this proggie you can just save the text files with serial
lists all in one dir, and search them when you need one. I just used the
web before, but this proggie definitely kills any reason you may have to
use a dbase program for it.


There are a lot more uses for this proggie, i just downloaded and installed
recently, so i'm bound to come up with more :)


Password updating. (trash your dbase program - reason3)
using a password tracker.

Just like most of the male internet users, i spent a good part of
my first 6 weeks or so online, exploring the xxx hierarchy of the web's
urls :) Soon i came across a proggie called password tracker deluxe. It
makes the updating of passwords (for sites with pop up boxes) a lot faster.
I never used it much because by the time i had a big list of working
passwords, i'd pretty much seen all there was to see :). These days there's
only one site i need a password to, and i always find one when i need it.
;) The use of a proggie like this though, can be valuable to password site
maintainers, who need to check long lists of passwords, as well as to
hackers, who maybe, just maybe, may find it interesting to know which ones
still work ;P .

<font size=+2>How to remove ugly advertisement banners</font>

<hr width=44%>There are 600 million sites 
out there, doubling every four months... and many of them carry absolutely useless banners 
and ads. Of course you are using a good browser, like Opera, that allows you to shut off 
all images whenever you want, in order to access quickly the contents you are searching. But 
at times you are yourself forced to use a "free" space provider, that will impose on your 
pages its ugly banners. This section of my site is dedicated to the methods that we can use 
to get rid of them. As you'll see there are many possible options, and almost all of them 
involve some html or javascript tricks.<br>

The bastard advertisers argue that Netizens enter into an implicit agreement with Web 
companies to accept
their ads in exchange for free information, similar to television viewers forced to slurp 
commercials
in exchange for free programming. But there are no explicit agreements, and many users want to
rid their surfing experiences of large banner ads that can take minutes to load, so, let's proceed...
<bR><br>
First of all IMO may have to find the EARLY copies of some interesting software solutions, as you'll see below, 
most of them have been subsequently censured or volontarly crippled :-(
<hr width=44%>
James Howard, created Internet Fast Forward, one of the first programs designed to filter out banner ads. 
<br><bR>
The software he produced was discontinued due to liability problems after he sold his company, PrivNet, to Pretty Good Privacy in November 1996. Howard said Internet companies had threatened to sue, accusing his company of violating their copyrights and modifying their pages. Howard had countered that users were the ones who controlled the content, not the software producers. 
<br><br>
PGP decided the risk of lawsuits was too great and <font color=blue>stopped production of the ad filtering program</fonT>. 
<br><br>


<hr width=44%>
Solid Oak, the Internet filtering company that produces the Web filtering software Cybersitter, introduced tools to screen out banner ads. 
<bR><br>
Brian Milburn, president of Solid Oak, said he introduced the filtering technology in response to requests from some of Cybersitter's 1.2 million customers, many of whom use older computers with slow Internet connections that make viewing banner ads a time-intensive task. 
<br><br>
<u>One day later</u> the company <font color=blue>rescinded the tool that screens out ads in free email services</fonT>, because users sign contracts saying they will accept ads in exchange for free email, Milburn said.

On many free host, you have a banner added automaticaly on index.html.
If your user has JavaScript enabled, here his a trick, insert 


&lt;script language="Javascript">

&lt;!--

location.href="main.html"

//-->

&lt;/script>


between header and body.
It will be read before everything and the user even doesn't see (s)he has changed of page.

Hi, I somehow managed to remove the popups for virtual avenue by adding this codes before the
&lt;html&gt; of every page.

//to avoid Javascript error notice
&lt;script&gt;
function NoError() {
return(true);
} 
onerror=NoError; 
&lt;/script&gt;

//to prevent the pop-up
&lt;script&gt; 
va_rvjr137y=window.open; 
function OpenNullWin() {
this.window;
} 
function FakeOpen(url,nam,atr) {
return(new OpenNullWin());
} 
window.open=FakeOpen;
&lt;/script&gt;


Looking at the codes added by the server, va_rvjr137y seems to be the "window handle". By modifying the codes produced by Proxomitron, I was able to add this codes in to counter the popups. Just tested without the codes, the popup is seen. When I add in the codes, the pop-up disappeared.


For Xoom website, they will automatically add in an extra frame. To counter that, add in _XOOM into your links eg
http://members.xoom.com/Ryanosis/files.html
into
http://members.xoom.com/_XOOM/Ryanosis/files.html

But in this case, you will need a website director.

Another way is to add the codes
&lt;script language="JavaScript"&gt;

&lt;!--
if (top.location.href != location.href)
top.location.href = location.href;
// --&gt;

&lt;/script&gt;

On services that stick their banner code at the very end of your page, the simplest way to
eliminate the popups is to stick a "NOEMBED" tag after your closing "/HTML". This works fine for
me in Opera 3.60 and all versions of Netscape and MSIE tested. I figure why use javascript
against itself when you can use html against javascript and be more compatible (or is it
incompatible?) with more banners.<br>

<center>Well, this is a great essay: a SUMMA of the various techniques you can use in order to analyse an image, or a whole advertisement visual message, applied to a specific target: in this case a publicity for clothes, by "<i>Marlboro Classic</i>". Martine Joly offers here very valuable keys (and very deep inside knowledge) that anyone will be able 
to use in order to reverse -and to understand- the cascade of visual messages 
that we receive, all of them trying to push us irrationally (or better: very 
rationally from THEIR point of view) into buying some crap that we don't need 
at all. Be warned: this is a very scary matter, and what you'll read here will make 
you a little paranoid... and yet you'll never be paranoid enough, since you are compelled 
to live in a "global" society, without any alternatives, that not only allows this 
kind tricks to be thrown against unsuspecting poor slaves but <i>de facto</i> foster 
them... Note how the deep truth behind all 
old teachings from +ORC ("<i>By all means: learn rhetoric!"</i>) is  
being confirmed in every aspect of our reversing activity.
<bR>Clearly we must learn to reverse not only in order to "understand" the world around 
us, but -to put it simply- in order to "survive"... at least this is 
the lesson I have once more learned here... our enemies, the "commercial slave masters" 
seem to be clever... but their power is based on IGNORANCE. And even if we don't win (yet), 
at least we are going down with all our cannons shooting! Therefore let's fight the master 
of ignorance through the teaching of people that can help us learn a lot, as you will 
indeed learn, reading this: a great "thanks" to Martine Joly! (Hey, does MARE mean "Master of advertisement reverse engineering"? :-)</center><hR><pre>

I'm sorry, but after having searched the Web everywhere I could not find any ready-scanned 
image of the advertisement that I will analyze here. You'll have to content yourselves with the badly scanned image I have made myself, that is until some pious soul will find and send me (or reverser+) a better scanned image of this advertisement.

<p>
Let's go straight to the point: This Advertisement 
took a double page of the Magazine "<i>Nouvel Observateur</i>" on 17 October 1991 (I wrote a 
paper on this two years later).<bR> 
This French  Magazine has an intello-leftist readership: middle class vaguely left 
oriented French managers and similar people. The fact that it has been published in 
OCTOBER is important, seen the contents of the product promoted.
</p>
<b>Description:</b><bR>
The advertismeent takes a DOUBLE page of the magazine. <br>
The left page is completely filled by a dark picture: brown tones on a white-gray background, of part of the chest and abdomen of a person without face, wearing a leather blazer, we see his right hand, leather gloved, holding the reins of an horse that we do not see, we see only  the horn cap of the saddle and a little part of the crest between neck and back of the horse.
The whole picture represents an huge dark lump that fills the whole space of the right diagonal part of 
the image.</p>
<p>
The right page carries on the top third a small picture (8cm * 10 cm), centred, that represents a snow-filled landscape: some wooden barriers that seem to delimit a corral, on a background of snow and trees without leaves. There is no sky at all in this image.
</p><p>
There is a text above this smaller image: "<i>L'hiver est proche, nos points de vente aussi</i>" (in English:  "Neither winter nor our selling points are far away". Below the image there is a complete list of French addresses divided by categories: "<i>Boutiques exclusives</i>",  "<i>Corners</i>" and  "<i>Points de vente</i>". The town and city names are underlined. This list of names and addresses fills almost the whole page.
</p><p>
Below, always on the right page, centred and in big bold characters, there is the Product logo: "<I>Marlboro Classic</i>" and below this, smaller: "<i>Fits the man</i>".
</p><p>
A very small reference sends you to a tiny translation on the right side: "<i>Habille les hommes</i>" which finds, on the left side of the right page, a counterpart: "<i>Un produit de Marlboro Leisure Wear</i>"
</p><p>
The whole visual message contains THREE different messages: a plastic message, an iconic message and a linguistic message. We will analyse all three messages, and then see how they interact.
</p><p>
The plastic message<bR>
The frame<br>
Each image has physical limits, that are more or less indicated by a frame, according to the various époques and styles. The frame is often seen has a restriction, and that's the reason that you will often see tricks in order to "abolish" or let people "forget" it, from internal re-framing to the simple discarding of the frame.
</p><p>
On the left page the image does not have any frame, it looks "cut", interrupted by the page margins, therefore we cannot see the rest of it "because the page is too small".
</p><p>
This trick: amalgamating the frame (or better: the frame-limits) with the marges of the support (here the 
left page of the magazine) has particular consequences on the imagination of the spectator. In fact this cut, whose responsibility seems to lay more on the dimensions of the support than on the choice of the image, pushes the spectator to RECONSTRUCT in his imagination what he does not see in the visual field of the representation, but that must exist to complete the image snippet he is seeing: the "outside".
</p><p>
The lack of a frame on the left page (where the reading <i>begins</i>, never forget this!) creates a "<font color=blue>centrifugal</fonT>" image with an imaginary complementary construction. This kind of approach references implicitly the universe of cinema, that has so often used this kind of tricks.
</p><p>
The white space on the LEFT page, on the contrary, is the frame for the small picture, that finds place like a small window inside the upper third of the page. Here the 'thick' frame incorporates, on the contrary,  the visual representation, and starts a process of "<font color=blue>centripetal</font>" reading that invites the spectator to "get inside" the fictive depth, like a landscape painting. This kind of approach references painting traditions, not the universe of cinema.
</p><p>
The framing<br>
Understand the difference between framing and frame. The frame is the LIMIT of the visual representation, the framing is the size of the image, the result of the distance between object in the picture and objective.
The two different framing on the two pages are in total opposition. A vertical and very NEAR framing on the left side gives you the impression of being really next to the subject; the horizontal, large framing on the right page gives you on the contrary the impression of being far far away. Note how the two framing propose at the same time a comparative reversing of the relative proportions: what is SMALL (the blazer) acts VERY BIG and what is BIG (nature, landscape) acts VERY SMALL.
</p><p>
Choice of the Objective and picture angle<br>
The choice of these two elements is VERY IMPORTANT, because it strengthens or eliminates the impression of reality due to the photographic support (Photographic pictures are NOT drawings, they should depict 'reality').
</p><p>
In the left image the angle is from the perspective of a person standing on his feet in the proximity of another riding a horse, who gains therefore height and Strength. In the second image, on the right page, on the contrary, you have an angle 'from above' and get the impression that you 'dominate' the landscape.
</p><p>
Note how on the left image they did choose a long objective (see the little 'flou' effects?). The opposition between these 'flou' zones, behind and below, and the clear unclouded blazer and horn cap brings automatically your eyes on some elements of this pictures against others, and decides in this way the privileged zones of attention of this advertisement. These are exactly the points that you need to individuate in order to understand and reverse the 'hidden' meanings of this image. Even the lack of depth is a trick: it transforms a place in a "nowhere place", and therefore an "everywhere place" as well.
</p><p>
Composition and paging<bR>
The composition is the intern geography of a visual message, one of the 
most important plastic tools of the advertisers. Composition plays a fundamental 
role in the hierarchysation of your vision, orienting the reading of the image 
that you will perform. In ANY image (painting, film-plan, drawing whatever) the 
construction is fundamental and may respect, or rebuke a series of conventions 
that have been developed in different époques, periods and styles. Yet eyes 
always follow THE PATH THAT HAS BEEN PREPARED INSIDE THE IMAGE.  The existence 
of reading patterns is well known, the most obvious ones are the left to right 
Euroamerican one, the Top to bottom Sino-Japanese one, and the right to left 
Arabic one. In advertisement there are four possibilities:<bR>
1)	the "lines of power" construction: these imaginary lines point towards a part 
of the advertisement that works as a fulcrum. Your vision is "pulled" towards the 
strategically placed location of the product name.
<br>2)	The axial construction: the product is placed exactly on the axis of your vision, generally in the exact middle of the advertisement.
<br>3)	The "in depth" construction: the product is integrated in a perspective placed scene and has the first plan inside this painstakingly constructed scene.
<bR>4)	The sequential construction: your vision follows the advertisement and then 'falls" at the end of the path, on the product, that in a left-right Euroamerican orientation of the reading will be mostly on the bottom right of the advertisement. The most typical model of sequential construction is the "Z" form: you begin on the top left side, something happens that brings your vision to the top right, then something sends you on the bottom left and read a small text that runs towards the bottom right, with the representation of the product or of the product logo or of the product name.
</p><p>
These constructions correspond to different strategies: if you throw on the market a new product you will try to use the axial construction, where the product monopolises the image and throws its colours and lights towards you. If you are advertising a well known and already existing product you will use targeted and in depth constructions. If you want to attribute to the product qualities that do not exists (the most interesting reversing targets) you will use a sequential construction that shifts during the reading the qualities of the advertisement (luxury, nature, see, naked women, whatever) onto the product. This, being the most vicious advertisement technique, has been forbidden in Europe for cigarettes. As we will see, Marlboro has found a way around it.
</p><p>
Let's go back to our image and notice its sequential construction, from left to right, falling then onto the Marlboro logo, below, on the right page. Each page has its own logic:
</p><p>
On the left side the oblique slope of the mass carries your vision from the most luminous point of the whole advertisement, the saddle horn, which has been placed in axial position, in a slope towards the top right side of the left page, where you will be able to 'pass' to the right page and read the verbal comment, then you will fall vertically from the top to the bottom of the right page and land on the product name. See how 'dynamic' is the sequential construction as well: in our society an oblique line from bottom left to top right "/", is often associated with dynamic, energy, progress, hope and so on, while the contrary, an oblique descending towards right "\" is more connected with falling, regression, destruction. See also how on the right page the descending reading is VERTICAL and not OBLIQUE, avoiding the 'negative' associations and favouring "equilibrium" and "straightness". 
</p><p>
FORMS<br>
Form interpretation is basically anthropological and cultural. Let's have a look at our target: once more we notice a system of oppositions: left we have SOFT forms, that are organised as a mass, right we have a system of LINES, slim and vertical, at times underlined horizontally. These lines recall the lines inside the small picture. The whole right page is composed of small thin lines on a white background, looks like a very slow and 'cosy' snowfall. At the bottom of the right page the dark mass of the typographical characters echoes visually the soft mass of the left page where the cylindrical vertical form negates all 'softness'.
</p><p>
COLOURS AND LIGHT<br>
The colours are the same in both pictures: brown, light grey, silver, white. The typographical characters are black on a white background. WHITE: colour of the COLD, of SNOW, of NORTH (and in the Western world, of purity, chastity, innocence, hygiene,  simplicity, peace, wise, old, aristocracy, monarchy and godness as well). GREY, colour of heavy sky and metal. Black and white as contrary of the colours, BROWN for earth, tree- rinds, leather, fur. These evident associations are in our target even more underlined by the iconic signs themselves. The warmness of the browns fights here against the coldness of the greys, silvers and white.
</p><p>
Light is DIFFUSE in both pictures. The winter sky does not have shadows nor depth. This kind of light is used to diminish the reality of images, since you loose space parameters, loose depth, get more quiet colours. It's a trick to block for the spectator any possibility of time-reference. This pushes even more the imprecise character of the place and time of the representation. This helps once more to generalise the representation.
</p><p>
Note also how the TEXTURE differs between the two pictures: Left there is some "granularity" and a supposed "thickness", while the picture on the right is smooth and "glaced", which underlines the character of coldness and distance of this image. So we have a TACTILE texture on the left and a VISUAL texture on the right.
</p><p>
Analysing the relation between the two pages we find therefore not so much an antithesis but an <i>oxymoron</i>, 
a rhetorical figure ("a combination for epigrammatic effect of contradictory 
or incongruous words" <font color=purple>"Make haste slowly"</fonT>) 
that produces -putting next to each other two opposed terms- a global signification which is somehow "tamed" and enriched by the opposed values of its two elements. As Master +ORC wrote: A good knowledge of ancient rhetoric is a powerful weapon indeed when you need to reverse the world around you... "better than kung-fu" to defend yourself in the virtual world of images, messages and subliminal conditioning of to-day.
</p><p>
ICONIC  OF THE MESSAGE<br> 
We already saw some of the iconic figurative signs reading the verbal message. Clearly, in this kind of target, every single element has ANOTHER meaning, different from the 'obvious' one.
</p><p>
On the left page we have recognised a leather blazer, an arm and a gloved hand holding the reins of an unseen horse. We also have a saddle horn and a part of the neck of the animal.
</p><p>
On the right page we have a snowed landscape, with the barriers of an empty corral.
</p><p>
Here we have a synecdochical representation (or metonymical) we see actually only PARTS of elements that are there to suggest a WHOLE by contiguity, like as the lack of a frame pushed us to reconstruct the missing rest of the image. Here is the significant chain:
</p><hr sizae=1><pre>
ICONIC			FIRST LEVEL	SECOND LEVEL

Part of a blazer	blazer		choice of clothes
					Man clothes

saddle horn		saddle		horse-riding, nature
					virility

mane hairs		horse neck	horse	far-west

soft leather		natural product	warmth, sensuality
					resistance, protection

leather glove,		man hand	Chill, comfort	Toughness
hand					strength	Equilibrium
"soft wrist" 				calm, flexibility
attitude					 

saddle horn		rest point	strength	phallic virility
vertical, hard	saddle			physical capability

reins			horse		nature, dominion	far west

snowed landscape			Chill, hard natural reality

empty corral		far west	Marlboro cigarettes
			cow boy moving</prE><hr size=1><p>
Of course you may depict differently the various relations, yet you will always land grossomodo on the same results. As you can see, even if you only see a limited amount of circumstances, these elements are more than enough to denote a series of qualities that are attributed to an imaginary man, solid and sport-oriented, with his equilibrium and his comfortable attitude, that gradually will be identified with the stereotyped cow-boy image that has been repeated and vulgarised in the last years by Marlboro for its Cigarettes.
</p><p>
The attitude of the model<br>
In advertisement, typically, models can<br> 
<bR>
<br>either 1)	"look you straight in the eyes", giving you the impression of having an interpersonal relation with you, mostly with an "I" and "You" colloquial attitude. 
<br>
<br>Or 2)	look somewhere else, and invite you to look to a third party or personage or event as well.
</p><p>
In the first case you need to speak with somebody, you need to obey to somebody, in the second case you wish to imitate and get some of the qualities of the model. I'll leave to my readers the sad task to understand the relevant implications of both approaches :--)
</p><p>
Here we don't even have the FACE of the model, yet his arm and hand suggest quite a lot. Not only are we missing his face, the whole head has been cut off. The 'impossible' and provocative effect of this decapitation, that could differ too much from the 'usual' advertisement horizon of the spectator, where faces play a preponderant role, is in our target diminished by a series of complementary aspects.
</p><p>
-	The lack of a frame stimulates -as we have seen- the spectator to reconstruct the missing face (as well as the rest of the body, of the horse, of the landscape...).
<br>-	The fact that you concentrate your regard on the chest, and on the protective curve of the arm gives you more the impression of security and comfort that the impression of watching a body cut ion pieces (as you are actually doing).
<br>-	The absence of a precise physiognomy allows anyone to give to the model HIS preferred physiognomy, among others his own one :--)
</p><p>
The absence of the face denotes the <u>most important rhetorical figure</u> of this advertisement target: the ellipsis (from the greek word elleipsis: 
omission). The ellipsis is a very important rhetorical figure in all form of advertisement and 
subliminal conditioning (therefore loved and used by politicians, PR-men and crooks 
alike): 
it plays on the non-said, on the non-showed. Instead of developing an argument through its clean-cut, explicit argumentations, the ellipsis plays on the 'knowledges' that the reader/spectator already has, and creates a sort of complicity between initiated (+ORC himself uses it throughout his tutorial :--)
</p><p>
Here your already present knowledge NOT ONLY reconstructs the missing face of the cow-boy, but GIVES HIM THE ABSENT CHARACTER OF THE MARLBORO COW-BOY lui-même. Through a series of publicity (quite dirty) tricks, Marlboro has passed its cow-boy symbology from cigarettes to fire-lighters and then to clothes. This diversification does not block the 'recognising' of the cigarettes product. This elliptical understanding gives you a sensation of complicity, the pleasure of the connivance, a new transgression  that cannot be punished: nothing has been REALLY said, nothing has been REALLY shown.. there is nothing to say.
</p><p>
The ellipsis plays in our target another role: the advertisement gains a 'temporal' reserve: the corral on the right page is empty. It was full of horses at a given time before, it will be full again in the future: we are therefore in a transitory moment, between the last travel and the next one.
</p><p>
THE LINGUISTIC MESSAGE<bR>
Images (as we have seen here) carry a LOT of messages. The text is therefore very important to eliminate part of the polysemantic variants offered by the images.
You find here (on the right page, at the bottom) "Marlboro Classic". This is reassuring, clearly, if the notice would have been "Paris 1912", for instance, the 
spectator would have been taken by surprise (another not so fancy technique).
</p><p>
Here we have a triple linguistic message: a legend: "L'hiver est proche, nos points de vente aussi"; a list of addresses, the product "Marlboro classic" and an 'explanation':  "Fits the man", with French translation.
</p><p>
Before analysing the "contents", let's have a look at the very important typographical 
aspect of the words, i.e. choice of fonts, colours and disposition on the page. As you 
can see you have bold and thick characters for the logo, uppercase slim for the legend 
and little caps for the addresses. The legend "L'hiver est proche, nos points de vente aussi" (this 
target has been published in October, as we have seen) corresponds to the time reality of 
the moment, and works as ANCHOR and as CONNECTOR.
</p><p>
As ANCHOR since it defines winter, the cold season, snow as a privileged reading 
level for the whole target among all other elements that we have seen. As CONNECTOR 
for the rest of the message. In fact the vicinity in time of a particular season (or 
whatever else) cannot be exprimed graphically... that's the reason you still have in 
films and cartoons the small "one month later" written advices... how should the 
spectator or reader, anchored in his subjective real time else follow the virtual 
imposed film or cartoon time?</p><p>
Here there is as well a play between the temporal proxility of the winter 
season and the spatial proximity of the shops where you (should) buy these clothes. 
Note also how they use a "nos". This "we" create a relation with an implicit 
"vous"/"you" that could have been represented visually, but that is impossible in 
this target seen that there is no "face" and therefore the interpersonal involvment 
is demandated to the text. "Points de vente" is also a notion that the target prefers 
NOT to represent visually (seen that it would underline the 'purpose' of the whole 
operation) and that has been graphically eliminated choosing instead 
other images and associations 
that bring more positive imagination stimuli with them.</p><p>
Once more some rhetoric (we will never insist enough on its importance): the text 
uses here a variant of the ellipsis: the <i>zeugma</i> from greek <i>zeugnumi</i>: yoke.
A phrase in which one word modifies or governs two or more not connected in meaning: <font 
color=purple>"Miss Bolo went straight home in a flood of tears and a sedan 
chair" (Dickens, Pickwick, XXXV)</fonT>. usually the zeugma is used to give as granted, 
in a period, some terms used in a previous sentence. The correct French phrase would have been: 
"L'hiver est proche, nos points de vente sont proches aussi". but here the quality of one 
part of the period are passed onto the other part: season and time "go over" to the 
shops where you can buy; Winter=shop; time and space are mixed in one ineluttable 
necessity: winter comes (true) therefore I must get some warm Marlboro clothes (or 
either at least smoke a Marlboro cigarette).
</p><p>
The long list of addresses gives the impression that Marlboro classic is everywhere, 
universal, like the use of an english part 'Fits the man' on a French magazine 
underlines as well. Not the use of "the"... fits the whole human race.
</p><p>
SYNTHESE<bR>
The reader that has followed my text until this point can easily perform 
a synthese of this target's real messages. I'll leave this as an useful 
exercise to you. I will just finish, after all these words of mine, repeating 
the old (true) proverb: a good image is worth a lot of text pages...</p>
<p>
Reverse well! (and, yes, I know that my English is far from perfect... anybody wants 
to proof-read and correct this? Please do).

INTRODUCTION

I have been watching all these sites on cracking and hacking..
and I have not found any crack on EDA tools...may be that 
very few people use it.  Some time back I needed a crack for
VERIWELL and I had posted a request on alt.2600, for which
I did not get any reply, so then and there I decided to get 
into cracking and I learned lot of things about cracking 
from reverser's page... now I am in a postion to write an essay
on cracking...please understand that this is my first essay
and that I am very bad at writing long essays

	Well in this essay I will tell you how I cracked
some targets which have been protected by STUPID dongles. 
I hope you all will like it, and I hope this will teach all 
shareware programmers reading this, that dongles, contrarily 
to their advertisement, are not a very good option if you 
intend to protect seriously... you don't believe me? Just read 
on...

TOOLS REQUIRED

Hexedit (I like the win 3.1 version, as it is very fast)
Win32dis (You all know it)
(So I won't even use softice to crack a couple of dongles :-)

TARGET URLs

www.wellspring.com
ftp.interhdl.com

THINGS YOU MUST REMEMBER 

1) Always try to find the golden routine that checks for the dongle.
2) Try to understand what it is doing...before jumping into patching it.
3) Have lot of patience.

ESSAY


PART I

Download any PC version tool from interhdl..as all the tools from
interhdl has got same stupid dongle protection (why can't they think
something better :-)
Here my target is verilint..after downloading you have
install it and after that just go to dos prompt and 
type verilint example.v

this will give a error message and then it will terminate.

the error message is "checking out hardware key"

so there are two things going on
1) check for hardware lock
2) terminate if hardware lock not found

first we will disable the call responsible for dongle check
so search for the string "checking out hardware key"

once you have found this, just scroll up till you find the call which
has called this routine. below is the code which has called this
routine.
you see that this routine has been called by another call instruction at
location 0004821f...so please go to the location 0004821f.

all you have to do is make that jump on equal to Always jump

:0048218A 740A                    je 00482196 //change 74 to EB

Don't forget to nop the call that checks for dongle..other
wise your program will waste lot of your time.

:0048217F E8ECFEFFFF              call 00482070
          9090909090              nop
        
        
        PART-II


Second target is a verilog simulator tool from wellsring, this target 
has got bit good protection then the first....it checks for the
hardware lock and if present it stores some values in some 
locations and it checks for dongle four time.from four different 
location...you need to patch only first two..but don't worry 
about it every dongle protection can be cracked............ 
first Download the veriwell.zip from the download page of 
www.wellspring.com and install it. Once you are through this you 
can follow what I'll tell you 

	Now run the veriwell, you see that it shows the following
message " this is free version of bla..bla..bla"
			

Hey I forgot to tell you that this software runs in demo mode
if hardware lock is not present, the above message was therefore 
due to this feature of veriwell. Now that you have found this, you can
fire your win32disa and dissamble the veriwell.exe and search for the
string "this is free bla..bla" or you can search for the string
"serial number"			
 
:0041015F A122785500              mov eax, dword ptr [00557822]
:00410164 50                      push eax

* Possible StringData Ref from Data Obj -&gt;"  Serial number %d"
                                  |
:00410165 68A4255300              push 005325A4
:0041016A E8AD33FFFF              call 0040351C

Veriwell reaches this line only if the hardware lock is preset
so We need to trace where this was done..to do this
we just page-up till we reach this piece of the code

:00410052 F6058078550001          test byte ptr [00557880], 01
:00410059 7522                    jne 0041007D 

//hardware lock is present then jump to 00410070

:0041005B 33C0                    xor eax, eax 

//if bad guy store zero in following locations

:0041005D A35CC95400              mov dword ptr [0054C95C], eax
:00410062 A33CCA5400              mov dword ptr [0054CA3C], eax
:00410067 A324CA5400              mov dword ptr [0054CA24], eax
:0041006C A32CCA5400              mov dword ptr [0054CA2C], eax
:00410071 A348CA5400              mov dword ptr [0054CA48], eax
:00410076 A320CA5400              mov dword ptr [0054CA20], eax
:0041007B EB5F                    jmp 004100DC

I bet this is very easy to patch all you have to do is  open the hexedit
and find the byte and nop them 

jne &lt;= nop
xor &lt;= nop

after you have doen this run the veriwell again, you see that it does not 
show the "free version banner" but still we have a problem...when ever we 
run the veriwell it takes lot of time to run...so we have to disable the
dongle check routine..So we page-up till we reach this peace of code


:0041001E E85FE40500              call 0046E482
//this is tha call that chscks for the dongle..just get into the call and
change the first bye of the call to C3..so that the call returs back as soon
as it executes the reutrn code.

now once again run the veriwell ...we find that it display the following message
                     "this is (%) of free version 
once again we search for the this string and again pageup till
we reach up to this code

once you have have done this...veriwell is yours..

FINAL NOTES

 This EDA tools are very "costly" compared to normal software, but I don't
understand one thing..if their software is really so costly, why don't they
protect it better? It would be pretty easy, seen the above code...</prE>

<H3>The commonest tricks and the CD-Rom landscape</H3><br>by reverser+, 
January 1999<br><bR>

The increase in illegal copying and burning of CD, that -take note- we 
don't condone if made for commercial purposes, seems now to be a phenomenon 
that has taken such a dimension that IMO the 
producers should better try to understand correctly instead of annoying 
software reversers that have NOTHING to do with it... see, I'm not speaking 
of the fact that you can buy wherever in Russia now (on the Arbat!) whole 
compilations for 2 Euro (each one of them containing the most recent 
software, each CD worth 4-5000 Euros) since you could have 
done that even before the disappearance of the good old Soviet Union, 
in Singapore, Beyruth, Belgrad or even at the rastro in Madrid... and since 
actually there'snt any need to spend even 
those 2 lonely Euros, on a huge web where you 
can download whatever you fancy for free 
from any decent warez site.<br><br>BTW, you may as well say 
goodbye to copyrighted music... to use Seidman's recent words: 
"<font color=purple>Dear Music Company Executives,
The software to encode music into MP3 format already exists.  I already
have it on my computer.  So do a lot of other people.  You will not be
able to stop it because it is already there.  Do you get it? 

I know you're scared.  I don't blame you.  But the genie is already out of
the bottle and try as you might, you won't be able to stuff it back in. 
Get over it. You can store
about 150 songs in MP3 format on a CD or about 10 HOURS of music on one
CD.  The Diamond Rio, which holds 60 minutes of music is only the TIP of
the iceberg.</font>"<br>Of course Seidman's is right... and I may add that all the 
encryption plans of those same commercial bastards (my own translation of 
music company executives :-) mean only more fun for our reversing studies... :-)
<bR><br>Yet the real problem remains another, IMO: the real problem   
is that there are many completely 'legal' HARDWARE fellons out there, that 
should worry the copyright holders even more than the warez-pirates that sell (and protect :-) 
their (protected) pirated CD (like Twilight).<br>You want an hardware example? Here you go: 
Memodis has 
announced a CD-ROM burner that can chain up to 28 burners together in groups 
of seven. It's a PC-independent hardware pirate-dream, that will be 
delivered in three version, the biggest one with 7 burners and a LCD screen... 
now, pray tell me, who will use this product? Ah ah... the 'free market' laws 
of demand and offer should always be respected... :-(<br><bR>
So let's do our work: let's reverse engineer software protection schemes, since 
 this field because is relevant for our reverse 
engineering studies.<br><bR>
CD-ROM protection schemes are based on some common tricks: first of all the idea 
(actively spreaded by some software houses) that there is some space 'between 
tracks' on a CD, that would be written on the original CD and 
checked by the protection scheme is nonsense. A Cd-ROM track is a spiral. The 
main protection schemes used to day to avoid CD-ROM copying are based on the 
fact that CD-ROM disks have a layout divised in tracks. The common structure 
is


 <prE>
Track #1 - MODE1
Track #2 - MODE2
Track #3 - AUDIO
Track #4 - AUDIO
Track #5 - MODE1
</prE><br>
Note that in multisession CD-EXTRA discs the audio tracks are in the first 
session and there is a data track in the second sesssion.
<br>
This 'mixed' mode stuff is used to "protect" games from being copied 
by beginners. Adaptect's software, for instance cannot duplicate (on purpose) 
these mixed CDs. You'll need to use better software (CdWin or, even better, Nero) 
to do it.
<br>
All the protection schemes based on the above structure can be easily cracked. There are 
two kind of protection schemes that are more difficult to crack (yet they are 
not uncrackable, of course :-) and these are Kodak Photo-CDs and Sony 
Playstation games (I don't mean those that you can bypass fixing the 
playstatiuon unit), which both contain inside their 
pre-header (or subroutines) some code that initializes the lusers' machine. 
<hr width=44% ALIGN=LEFT>
Let's have a look at the commonest tricks:<bR>
<b>Trick</b>: To avoid CD-copy, the most banal trick is to make the CD's bigger 
than the usual format. You will therefore not be able to copy 
the CD on a regular (74 minutes) CD.<bR>

<b>Bypass</b>: there are two possible options to copy an 'enlarged' protected 
CD:<br>
<b>1)</b> Get hold of good software that can copy more data 
on regular CD's (CDRWin, for instance... but the best software IMO is 
Nero. If you use Nero, then <u>'Ignore 
Illegal TOC' + 'Ignore Read Errors' + 'Unreadable Data' & continue
copying'</u>)
<bR><b>2)</b> get CD's that are large enough to hold all the data.
<bR><b>3)</b>If your CD-Recorder supports overburning (TEAC, PLEXTOR, YAMAHA) then u can
enable the overburn option in NERO ('Preferences' &
Advanced settings' & 'enable CD oversize'). If you are not sure 
all the data of the original disk will fit then
just use a 80 minutes CD-R.
<bR>
<br>
<b>Trick</b>: As it was to be expected, there are now a series 
of protection schemes out 
that use partitions that are larger than 
the largest CD-r available. Interestingly enough, pirates have been the 
first one to use this kind of protection (Twilight began using this kind of protection 
from number 15, and went 'bigger' from number 21).<br>
<b>Bypass</b>: 
<b>1)</b>: (simple): Crack the scheme (remove the CD-size check from the menu).<br>
<b>2)</b>: (expensive): use CDRWin with one of the 
following recorders: Plextor PX-R412 Ci; 
Teac CDR 55 S; ALL Yamaha recorders; Panasonic 7502. The reason you should use 
CDRWIn has to do with the ToC of all CD-Roms: Every CD contains a table of contents (TOC) and a Lead In in which is listed
what is on the CD, so the CD-ROM drive can find the data on the disc. This
TOC is on every CD and will be written by the start of every recording
session. And this of course takes up space on the CD so less space is
available for the actual data. This is where CDRWin comes in; the TOC and
Lead In written by CDRWin (CDRWin: www.goldenhawk.com) are much smaller if you compare it to other recording
software (NERO: www.ahead.de;  
Creator Deluxe: www.adaptec.com; 
DiskJuggler: www.padus.com; Prassi CD
Replicator: www.prassi.com; Feurio
www.feurio.de everyone of these programs 
can be fished from the web) <bR>

This important project was started by the +HCU in May 1997. Take note: part of the following 
essays are considered 
HISTORY of the cracking scene, and relate to various CD-Rom protection schemes.
<bR>Please note that there are on the <a href="academy.htm" tppabs="http://members.xoom.com/tsehp_/academy.htm">academy</a> many 
other CD-related essays that should be included in here (anyone has the

Hackmore+Readrite) where we definitely came to the conclusion that +ORC is dutch. Not German, not 
Swede: dutch. And the fact that 
a very well known Amiga cracker of the eighties had as a Nickname 'ORC' gave us much to 
think (but we found few 'beef' on the Web, unfortunately).
<br>Since +ORC is no more in contact with 
anyone of us, unfortunately, there's no way we can finish our stalking (I remember that when he 
wrote +gthorne that he was in Cairo (Egypt) for his hyerogliphical cracking, more than one year ago, 
I mobilized two egyptian crackers, who went in the CairoMuseum's bar asking if some funny 
european fellow had 
ordered considerable amounts of wodka-martini's... only to find out that no alcohol is 
served there :-(<bR>Yes, +ORC does not publish any more his 'how to crack' 
masterpieces... yet he can still be useful for all reversers 
as 
stalking quarry :-)<bR>I hope, in publishing this essay to open the way for  
some other good stalkers that want to improve their skills joining aZh nAZg 
in this fascinating 
stalking endeavour (a very difficult one now that the trial is cold). 
Good luck.<br>aZh nAZg's  
Nosferatu stalking is 
an impressive work of art and some of the evidences are quite heavy. Still I don't believe that +ORC is aZh nAZg's Swede: but 
this good swiss stalker may be right with the 
Idea that the tutorial has been translated from Cezch:
my personal alternative theory is that +ORC is the Petr Horàk that wrote in Prag (in 1982!) the 
beautiful utility KGB that you can download on my tools page... Horàk sounds a little 
like +ORC, see, and wasn't +ORC himself that wrote that <u>nomen est omen</u>? :-)

Who is/was +ORC?  A fine problem; perfect for a weeks contemplation. 
The Basilisk and others have already done fine work on bringing the
issue to resolution.  I soon realized that I was approaching a chase
where the trail was already long cold and well trampled.  Many
brilliant stalkers had already tried all of the obvious approaches; 
there was however, some comfort to be had in that, as that very fact
suggested that +ORC was either being *very* clever, or *very* candid.
</p>
<p>
While in regular stalking the trick is to have a good dictionary of
synonyms to feed into the search engines, the trick with Zen stalking
is to have an open mind ('zen mind'), untiring doggedness, and above
all, to 'psych' oneself into the mindset of one's quarry.
</p>
<p>
OK, so, mindset of quarry, now let's see...what do we know about him?
 The Lessons (read and re-read them all several times, getting a feel
for the language used), the Riddle itself, the URL and what it points
to, +ORC's mention of it leading to a 'dead' page...
</p>
<p>
Ok, Riddle:  the language used is heraldic, duh.  The quote is from,
well you know already, duh.  Some lines are different than the
original;  there's numeric symbology used, could be something about
shifting bits, adding, replacing numbers in the URL, after all, he was
an assembly coder...
</p>
<p>
...nope, he'd be *zen!* too lazy to do that for real. 
He'd want us to *think* we should do that -- mount an exhaustive
search of the Web -- and sit there revelling that he got all dem lamers up
off their butts and doing something useful.  But he's got a great
sense of humor, so mebbe the heraldic stuff is still a clue, jest a diff
sort of clue. Save it for lata...
</p>
<p>
The URL, of course leads into .mil territory, as
trcroute will reveal
(actually it winds up bouncing between two DNSs in
.mil until it dies
out).  But as we already know, someone  has visited reverser using that
URL as their (spoofed) IP address, so we know that
it's someone's
calling card.  How hard is it to do that?  Not very, I
could write the
code from scratch in an hour or so.
</p>
<p>
So, how about the reference to the 'dead' page?  Well, the obvious
thought is that what that means is a page that's no longer being
maintained.  I would imagine that many folks have already searched all
available engines for a +ORC directory, with mixed results (did you
find the Electric Company, in Minsk?).  But, I hand you +ORC's *own
words*: (Lesson 2: '...for those of you that do not know anything,
here is the ARCHIE way you get all the program that do EXIST on the
planet:...').  My favorite one is the one in Oldenburg, Germany
(<a href="file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Charlie/My%20Documents/My%20Webs/FRAVIA/new_page_1.htm">-oldenburg.de/Docs/net-serv/archie-gate.html</a>).  
Let's see...orc.htm...there it
is: www.sics.se/sicskatalog/orc/orc.htm, and hey! orc.gif as well. 
Let's see who this is...
</p>
<p>
Ok, its Lars-Hakan Loenn ... and what's this, his
nickname? 'Orc' ... well, well ... what does he do...search, search...a
hah!  He was a student at SU (university of Sweden) in 93, and in 94,
and...hmm, not in 95...where was he in 95...search, search...a Hah! He's at CalTech,
in the Swedish Club.  And he didn't graduate...so he was an exchange
student ... search, search ... he's into RPG (role playing games),
specifically Gothic ... search, search ... while at CalTech lists his
home server as <font color=blue>nosferatu.sics.se</fonT> ... search, search
... lot's of references to Gothic RPG.  Save that for later...
</p>
<p>
Ok, orc.htm -- view source -- nothing interesting here.  Spider
