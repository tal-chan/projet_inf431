on you depending,
Counts it your weal he have his liberty.
Enter HUBERT


KING JOHN

Let it be so: I do commit his youth
To your direction. Hubert, what news with you?
Taking him apart


PEMBROKE

This is the man should do the bloody deed;
He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine:
The image of a wicked heinous fault
Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
Does show the mood of a much troubled breast;
And I do fearfully believe 'tis done,
What we so fear'd he had a charge to do.


SALISBURY

The colour of the king doth come and go
Between his purpose and his conscience,
Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set:
His passion is so ripe, it needs must break.


PEMBROKE

And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence
The foul corruption of a sweet child's death.


KING JOHN

We cannot hold mortality's strong hand:
Good lords, although my will to give is living,
The suit which you demand is gone and dead:
He tells us Arthur is deceased to-night.


SALISBURY

Indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure.


PEMBROKE

Indeed we heard how near his death he was
Before the child himself felt he was sick:
This must be answer'd either here or hence.


KING JOHN

Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?
Think you I bear the shears of destiny?
Have I commandment on the pulse of life?


SALISBURY

It is apparent foul play; and 'tis shame
That greatness should so grossly offer it:
So thrive it in your game! and so, farewell.


PEMBROKE

Stay yet, Lord Salisbury; I'll go with thee,
And find the inheritance of this poor child,
His little kingdom of a forced grave.
That blood which owed the breadth of all this isle,
Three foot of it doth hold: bad world the while!
This must not be thus borne: this will break out
To all our sorrows, and ere long I doubt.
Exeunt Lords


KING JOHN

They burn in indignation. I repent:
There is no sure foundation set on blood,
No certain life achieved by others' death.
Enter a Messenger
A fearful eye thou hast: where is that blood
That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?
So foul a sky clears not without a storm:
Pour down thy weather: how goes all in France?


Messenger

From France to England. Never such a power
For any foreign preparation
Was levied in the body of a land.
The copy of your speed is learn'd by them;
For when you should be told they do prepare,
The tidings come that they are all arrived.


KING JOHN

O, where hath our intelligence been drunk?
Where hath it slept? Where is my mother's care,
That such an army could be drawn in France,
And she not hear of it?


Messenger

My liege, her ear
Is stopp'd with dust; the first of April died
Your noble mother: and, as I hear, my lord,
The Lady Constance in a frenzy died
Three days before: but this from rumour's tongue
I idly heard; if true or false I know not.


KING JOHN

Withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!
O, make a league with me, till I have pleased
My discontented peers! What! mother dead!
How wildly then walks my estate in France!
Under whose conduct came those powers of France
That thou for truth givest out are landed here?


Messenger

Under the Dauphin.


KING JOHN

                  Thou hast made me giddy
With these ill tidings.
Enter the BASTARD and PETER of Pomfret
Now, what says the world
To your proceedings? do not seek to stuff
My head with more ill news, for it is full.


BASTARD

But if you be afeard to hear the worst,
Then let the worst unheard fall on your bead.


KING JOHN

Bear with me cousin, for I was amazed
Under the tide: but now I breathe again
Aloft the flood, and can give audience
To any tongue, speak it of what it will.


BASTARD

How I have sped among the clergymen,
The sums I have collected shall express.
But as I travell'd hither through the land,
I find the people strangely fantasied;
Possess'd with rumours, full of idle dreams,
Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear:
And here a prophet, that I brought with me
From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found
With many hundreds treading on his heels;
To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,
That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,
Your highness should deliver up your crown.


KING JOHN

Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?


PETER

Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.


KING JOHN

Hubert, away with him; imprison him;
And on that day at noon whereon he says
I shall yield up my crown, let him be hang'd.
Deliver him to safety; and return,
For I must use thee.
Exeunt HUBERT with PETER
O my gentle cousin,
Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arrived?


BASTARD

The French, my lord; men's mouths are full of it:
Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,
With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,
And others more, going to seek the grave
Of Arthur, who they say is kill'd to-night
On your suggestion.


KING JOHN

Gentle kinsman, go,
And thrust thyself into their companies:
I have a way to win their loves again;
Bring them before me.


BASTARD

I will seek them out.


KING JOHN

Nay, but make haste; the better foot before.
O, let me have no subject enemies,
When adverse foreigners affright my towns
With dreadful pomp of stout invasion!
Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,
And fly like thought from them to me again.


BASTARD

The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.
Exit


KING JOHN

Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman.
Go after him; for he perhaps shall need
Some messenger betwixt me and the peers;
And be thou he.


Messenger

                  With all my heart, my liege.
Exit


KING JOHN

My mother dead!
Re-enter HUBERT


HUBERT

My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night;
Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about
The other four in wondrous motion.


KING JOHN

Five moons!


HUBERT

Old men and beldams in the streets
Do prophesy upon it dangerously:
Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths:
And when they talk of him, they shake their heads
And whisper one another in the ear;
And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,
Whilst he that hears makes fearful action,
With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.
I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,
The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,
With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news;
Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,
Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste
Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,
Told of a many thousand warlike French
That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent:
Another lean unwash'd artificer
Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death.


KING JOHN

Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?
Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?
Thy hand hath murder'd him: I had a mighty cause
To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.


HUBERT

No had, my lord! why, did you not provoke me?


KING JOHN

It is the curse of kings to be attended
By slaves that take their humours for a warrant
To break within the bloody house of life,
And on the winking of authority
To understand a law, to know the meaning
Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns
More upon humour than advised respect.


HUBERT

Here is your hand and seal for what I did.


KING JOHN

O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth
Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal
Witness against us to damnation!
How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,
A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,
Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame,
This murder had not come into my mind:
But taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,
Finding thee fit for bloody villany,
Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,
I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death;
And thou, to be endeared to a king,
Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.


HUBERT

My lord--


KING JOHN

Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause
When I spake darkly what I purposed,
Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face,
As bid me tell my tale in express words,
Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,
And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me:
But thou didst understand me by my signs
And didst in signs again parley with sin;
Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,
And consequently thy rude hand to act
The deed, which both our tongues held vile to name.
Out of my sight, and never see me more!
My nobles leave me; and my state is braved,
Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers:
Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,
This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,
Hostility and civil tumult reigns
Between my conscience and my cousin's death.


HUBERT

Arm you against your other enemies,
I'll make a peace between your soul and you.
Young Arthur is alive: this hand of mine
Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,
Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.
Within this bosom never enter'd yet
The dreadful motion of a murderous thought;
And you have slander'd nature in my form,
Which, howsoever rude exteriorly,
Is yet the cover of a fairer mind
Than to be butcher of an innocent child.


KING JOHN

Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,
Throw this report on their incensed rage,
And make them tame to their obedience!
Forgive the comment that my passion made
Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,
And foul imaginary eyes of blood
Presented thee more hideous than thou art.
O, answer not, but to my closet bring
The angry lords with all expedient haste.
I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.
Exeunt

SCENE III. Before the castle.

Enter ARTHUR, on the walls


ARTHUR

The wall is high, and yet will I leap down:
Good ground, be pitiful and hurt me not!
There's few or none do know me: if they did,
This ship-boy's semblance hath disguised me quite.
I am afraid; and yet I'll venture it.
If I get down, and do not break my limbs,
I'll find a thousand shifts to get away:
As good to die and go, as die and stay.
Leaps down
O me! my uncle's spirit is in these stones:
Heaven take my soul, and England keep my bones!
Dies
Enter PEMBROKE, SALISBURY, and BIGOT


SALISBURY

Lords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury:
It is our safety, and we must embrace
This gentle offer of the perilous time.


PEMBROKE

Who brought that letter from the cardinal?


SALISBURY

The Count Melun, a noble lord of France,
Whose private with me of the Dauphin's love
Is much more general than these lines import.


BIGOT

To-morrow morning let us meet him then.


SALISBURY

Or rather then set forward; for 'twill be
Two long days' journey, lords, or ere we meet.
Enter the BASTARD


BASTARD

Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!
The king by me requests your presence straight.


SALISBURY

The king hath dispossess'd himself of us:
We will not line his thin bestained cloak
With our pure honours, nor attend the foot
That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks.
Return and tell him so: we know the worst.


BASTARD

Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.


SALISBURY

Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now.


BASTARD

But there is little reason in your grief;
Therefore 'twere reason you had manners now.


PEMBROKE

Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.


BASTARD

'Tis true, to hurt his master, no man else.


SALISBURY

This is the prison. What is he lies here?
Seeing ARTHUR


PEMBROKE

O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!
The earth had not a hole to hide this deed.


SALISBURY

Murder, as hating what himself hath done,
Doth lay it open to urge on revenge.


BIGOT

Or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,
Found it too precious-princely for a grave.


SALISBURY

Sir Richard, what think you? have you beheld,
Or have you read or heard? or could you think?
Or do you almost think, although you see,
That you do see? could thought, without this object,
Form such another? This is the very top,
The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,
Of murder's arms: this is the bloodiest shame,
The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke,
That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage
Presented to the tears of soft remorse.


PEMBROKE

All murders past do stand excused in this:
And this, so sole and so unmatchable,
Shall give a holiness, a purity,
To the yet unbegotten sin of times;
And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,
Exampled by this heinous spectacle.


BASTARD

It is a damned and a bloody work;
The graceless action of a heavy hand,
If that it be the work of any hand.


SALISBURY

If that it be the work of any hand!
We had a kind of light what would ensue:
It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand;
The practise and the purpose of the king:
From whose obedience I forbid my soul,
Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,
And breathing to his breathless excellence
The incense of a vow, a holy vow,
Never to taste the pleasures of the world,
Never to be infected with delight,
Nor conversant with ease and idleness,
Till I have set a glory to this hand,
By giving it the worship of revenge.


PEMBROKE

BIGOT

Our souls religiously confirm thy words.
Enter HUBERT


HUBERT

Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you:
Arthur doth live; the king hath sent for you.


SALISBURY

O, he is old and blushes not at death.
Avaunt, thou hateful villain, get thee gone!


HUBERT

I am no villain.


SALISBURY

                  Must I rob the law?
Drawing his sword


BASTARD

Your sword is bright, sir; put it up again.


SALISBURY

Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.


HUBERT

Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say;
By heaven, I think my sword's as sharp as yours:
I would not have you, lord, forget yourself,
Nor tempt the danger of my true defence;
Lest I, by marking of your rage, forget
Your worth, your greatness and nobility.


BIGOT

Out, dunghill! darest thou brave a nobleman?


HUBERT

Not for my life: but yet I dare defend
My innocent life against an emperor.


SALISBURY

Thou art a murderer.


HUBERT

Do not prove me so;
Yet I am none: whose tongue soe'er speaks false,
Not truly speaks; who speaks not truly, lies.


PEMBROKE

Cut him to pieces.


BASTARD

                  Keep the peace, I say.


SALISBURY

Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge.


BASTARD

Thou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury:
If thou but frown on me, or stir thy foot,
Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,
I'll strike thee dead. Put up thy sword betime;
Or I'll so maul you and your toasting-iron,
That you shall think the devil is come from hell.


BIGOT

What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?
Second a villain and a murderer?


HUBERT

Lord Bigot, I am none.


BIGOT

Who kill'd this prince?


HUBERT

'Tis not an hour since I left him well:
I honour'd him, I loved him, and will weep
My date of life out for his sweet life's loss.


SALISBURY

Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,
For villany is not without such rheum;
And he, long traded in it, makes it seem
Like rivers of remorse and innocency.
Away with me, all you whose souls abhor
The uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house;
For I am stifled with this smell of sin.


BIGOT

Away toward Bury, to the Dauphin there!


PEMBROKE

There tell the king he may inquire us out.
Exeunt Lords


BASTARD

Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?
Beyond the infinite and boundless reach
Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,
Art thou damn'd, Hubert.


HUBERT

Do but hear me, sir.


BASTARD

Ha! I'll tell thee what;
Thou'rt damn'd as black--nay, nothing is so black;
Thou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer:
There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell
As thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this child.


HUBERT

Upon my soul--


BASTARD

                  If thou didst but consent
To this most cruel act, do but despair;
And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest thread
That ever spider twisted from her womb
Will serve to strangle thee, a rush will be a beam
To hang thee on; or wouldst thou drown thyself,
Put but a little water in a spoon,
And it shall be as all the ocean,
Enough to stifle such a villain up.
I do suspect thee very grievously.


HUBERT

If I in act, consent, or sin of thought,
Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath
Which was embounded in this beauteous clay,
Let hell want pains enough to torture me.
I left him well.


BASTARD

                  Go, bear him in thine arms.
I am amazed, methinks, and lose my way
Among the thorns and dangers of this world.
How easy dost thou take all England up!
From forth this morsel of dead royalty,
The life, the right and truth of all this realm
Is fled to heaven; and England now is left
To tug and scamble and to part by the teeth
The unowed interest of proud-swelling state.
Now for the bare-pick'd bone of majesty
Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest
And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace:
Now powers from home and discontents at home
Meet in one line; and vast confusion waits,
As doth a raven on a sick-fall'n beast,
The imminent decay of wrested pomp.
Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can
Hold out this tempest. Bear away that child
And follow me with speed: I'll to the king:
A thousand businesses are brief in hand,
And heaven itself doth frown upon the land.
Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. KING JOHN'S palace.

Enter KING JOHN, CARDINAL PANDULPH, and Attendants


KING JOHN

Thus have I yielded up into your hand
The circle of my glory.
Giving the crown


CARDINAL PANDULPH

Take again
From this my hand, as holding of the pope
Your sovereign greatness and authority.


KING JOHN

Now keep your holy word: go meet the French,
And from his holiness use all your power
To stop their marches 'fore we are inflamed.
Our discontented counties do revolt;
Our people quarrel with obedience,
Swearing allegiance and the love of soul
To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.
This inundation of mistemper'd humour
Rests by you only to be qualified:
Then pause not; for the present time's so sick,
That present medicine must be minister'd,
Or overthrow incurable ensues.


CARDINAL PANDULPH

It was my breath that blew this tempest up,
Upon your stubborn usage of the pope;
But since you are a gentle convertite,
My tongue shall hush again this storm of war
And make fair weather in your blustering land.
On this Ascension-day, remember well,
Upon your oath of service to the pope,
Go I to make the French lay down their arms.
Exit


KING JOHN

Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet
Say that before Ascension-day at noon
My crown I should give off? Even so I have:
I did suppose it should be on constraint:
But, heaven be thank'd, it is but voluntary.
Enter the BASTARD


BASTARD

All Kent hath yielded; nothing there holds out
But Dover castle: London hath received,
Like a kind host, the Dauphin and his powers:
Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone
To offer service to your enemy,
And wild amazement hurries up and down
The little number of your doubtful friends.


KING JOHN

Would not my lords return to me again,
After they heard young Arthur was alive?


BASTARD

They found him dead and cast into the streets,
An empty casket, where the jewel of life
By some damn'd hand was robb'd and ta'en away.


KING JOHN

That villain Hubert told me he did live.


BASTARD

So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew.
But wherefore do you droop? why look you sad?
Be great in act, as you have been in thought;
Let not the world see fear and sad distrust
Govern the motion of a kingly eye:
Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire;
Threaten the threatener and outface the brow
Of bragging horror: so shall inferior eyes,
That borrow their behaviors from the great,
Grow great by your example and put on
The dauntless spirit of resolution.
Away, and glister like the god of war,
When he intendeth to become the field:
Show boldness and aspiring confidence.
What, shall they seek the lion in his den,
And fright him there? and make him tremble there?
O, let it not be said: forage, and run
To meet displeasure farther from the doors,
And grapple with him ere he comes so nigh.


KING JOHN

The legate of the pope hath been with me,
And I have made a happy peace with him;
And he hath promised to dismiss the powers
Led by the Dauphin.


BASTARD

O inglorious league!
Shall we, upon the footing of our land,
Send fair-play orders and make compromise,
Insinuation, parley and base truce
To arms invasive? shall a beardless boy,
A cocker'd silken wanton, brave our fields,
And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil,
Mocking the air with colours idly spread,
And find no cheque? Let us, my liege, to arms:
Perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace;
Or if he do, let it at least be said
They saw we had a purpose of defence.


KING JOHN

Have thou the ordering of this present time.


BASTARD

Away, then, with good courage! yet, I know,
Our party may well meet a prouder foe.
Exeunt

SCENE II. LEWIS's camp at St. Edmundsbury.

Enter, in arms, LEWIS, SALISBURY, MELUN, PEMBROKE, BIGOT, and Soldiers


LEWIS

My Lord Melun, let this be copied out,
And keep it safe for our remembrance:
Return the precedent to these lords again;
That, having our fair order written down,
Both they and we, perusing o'er these notes,
May know wherefore we took the sacrament
And keep our faiths firm and inviolable.


SALISBURY

Upon our sides it never shall be broken.
And, noble Dauphin, albeit we swear
A voluntary zeal and an unurged faith
To your proceedings; yet believe me, prince,
I am not glad that such a sore of time
Should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt,
And heal the inveterate canker of one wound
By making many. O, it grieves my soul,
That I must draw this metal from my side
To be a widow-maker! O, and there
Where honourable rescue and defence
Cries out upon the name of Salisbury!
But such is the infection of the time,
That, for the health and physic of our right,
We cannot deal but with the very hand
Of stern injustice and confused wrong.
And is't not pity, O my grieved friends,
That we, the sons and children of this isle,
Were born to see so sad an hour as this;
Wherein we step after a stranger march
Upon her gentle bosom, and fill up
Her enemies' ranks,--I must withdraw and weep
Upon the spot of this enforced cause,--
To grace the gentry of a land remote,
And follow unacquainted colours here?
What, here? O nation, that thou couldst remove!
That Neptune's arms, who clippeth thee about,
Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself,
And grapple thee unto a pagan shore;
Where these two Christian armies might combine
The blood of malice in a vein of league,
And not to spend it so unneighbourly!


LEWIS

A noble temper dost thou show in this;
And great affections wrestling in thy bosom
Doth make an earthquake of nobility.
O, what a noble combat hast thou fought
Between compulsion and a brave respect!
Let me wipe off this honourable dew,
That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks:
My heart hath melted at a lady's tears,
Being an ordinary inundation;
But this effusion of such manly drops,
This shower, blown up by tempest of the soul,
Startles mine eyes, and makes me more amazed
Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven
Figured quite o'er with burning meteors.
Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,
And with a great heart heave away the storm:
Commend these waters to those baby eyes
That never saw the giant world enraged;
Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
Full of warm blood, of mirth, of gossiping.
Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep
Into the purse of rich prosperity
As Lewis himself: so, nobles, shall you all,
That knit your sinews to the strength of mine.
And even there, methinks, an angel spake:
Enter CARDINAL PANDULPH
Look, where the holy legate comes apace,
To give us warrant from the hand of heaven
And on our actions set the name of right
With holy breath.


CARDINAL PANDULPH

                  Hail, noble prince of France!
The next is this, King John hath reconciled
Himself to Rome; his spirit is come in,
That so stood out against the holy church,
The great metropolis and see of Rome:
Therefore thy threatening colours now wind up;
And tame the savage spirit of wild war,
That like a lion foster'd up at hand,
It may lie gently at the foot of peace,
And be no further harmful than in show.


LEWIS

Your grace shall pardon me, I will not back:
I am too high-born to be propertied,
To be a secondary at control,
Or useful serving-man and instrument,
To any sovereign state throughout the world.
Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
Between this chastised kingdom and myself,
And brought in matter that should feed this fire;
And now 'tis far too huge to be blown out
With that same weak wind which enkindled it.
You taught me how to know the face of right,
Acquainted me with interest to this land,
Yea, thrust this enterprise into my heart;
And come ye now to tell me John hath made
His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?
I, by the honour of my marriage-bed,
After young Arthur, claim this land for mine;
And, now it is half-conquer'd, must I back
Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?
Am I Rome's slave? What penny hath Rome borne,
What men provided, what munition sent,
To underprop this action? Is't not I
That undergo this charge? who else but I,
And such as to my claim are liable,
Sweat in this business and maintain this war?
Have I not heard these islanders shout out
'Vive le roi!' as I have bank'd their towns?
Have I not here the best cards for the game,
To win this easy match play'd for a crown?
And shall I now give o'er the yielded set?
No, no, on my soul, it never shall be said.


CARDINAL PANDULPH

You look but on the outside of this work.


LEWIS

Outside or inside, I will not return
Till my attempt so much be glorified
As to my ample hope was promised
Before I drew this gallant head of war,
And cull'd these fiery spirits from the world,
To outlook conquest and to win renown
Even in the jaws of danger and of death.
Trumpet sounds
What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?
Enter the BASTARD, attended


BASTARD

According to the fair play of the world,
Let me have audience; I am sent to speak:
My holy lord of Milan, from the king
I come, to learn how you have dealt for him;
And, as you answer, I do know the scope
And warrant limited unto my tongue.


CARDINAL PANDULPH

The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,
And will not temporize with my entreaties;
He flatly says he'll not lay down his arms.


BASTARD

By all the blood that ever fury breathed,
The youth says well. Now hear our English king;
For thus his royalty doth speak in me.
He is prepared, and reason too he should:
This apish and unmannerly approach,
This harness'd masque and unadvised revel,
This unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops,
The king doth smile at; and is well prepared
To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,
From out the circle of his territories.
That hand which had the strength, even at your door,
To cudgel you and make you take the hatch,
To dive like buckets in concealed wells,
To crouch in litter of your stable planks,
To lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks,
To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out
In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake
Even at the crying of your nation's crow,
Thinking his voice an armed Englishman;
Shall that victorious hand be feebled here,
That in your chambers gave you chastisement?
No: know the gallant monarch is in arms
And like an eagle o'er his aery towers,
To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.
And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,
You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb
Of your dear mother England, blush for shame;
For your own ladies and pale-visaged maids
Like Amazons come tripping after drums,
Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,
Their needles to lances, and their gentle hearts
To fierce and bloody inclination.


LEWIS

There end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace;
We grant thou canst outscold us: fare thee well;
We hold our time too precious to be spent
With such a brabbler.


CARDINAL PANDULPH

Give me leave to speak.


BASTARD

No, I will speak.


LEWIS

                  We will attend to neither.
Strike up the drums; and let the tongue of war
Plead for our interest and our being here.


BASTARD

Indeed your drums, being beaten, will cry out;
And so shall you, being beaten: do but start
An echo with the clamour of thy drum,
And even at hand a drum is ready braced
That shall reverberate all as loud as thine;
Sound but another, and another shall
As loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear
And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder: for at hand,
Not trusting to this halting legate here,
Whom he hath used rather for sport than need
Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits
A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day
To feast upon whole thousands of the French.


LEWIS

Strike up our drums, to find this danger out.


BASTARD

And thou shalt find it, Dauphin, do not doubt.
Exeunt

SCENE III. The field of battle.

Alarums. Enter KING JOHN and HUBERT


KING JOHN

How goes the day with us? O, tell me, Hubert.


HUBERT

Badly, I fear. How fares your majesty?


KING JOHN

This fever, that hath troubled me so long,
Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!
Enter a Messenger


Messenger

My lord, your valiant kinsman, Faulconbridge,
Desires your majesty to leave the field
And send him word by me which way you go.


KING JOHN

Tell him, toward Swinstead, to the abbey there.


Messenger

Be of good comfort; for the great supply
That was expected by the Dauphin here,
Are wreck'd three nights ago on Goodwin Sands.
This news was brought to Richard but even now:
The French fight coldly, and retire themselves.


KING JOHN

Ay me! this tyrant fever burns me up,
And will not let me welcome this good news.
Set on toward Swinstead: to my litter straight;
Weakness possesseth me, and I am faint.
Exeunt

SCENE IV. Another part of the field.

Enter SALISBURY, PEMBROKE, and BIGOT


SALISBURY

I did not think the king so stored with friends.


PEMBROKE

Up once again; put spirit in the French:
If they miscarry, we miscarry too.


SALISBURY

That misbegotten devil, Faulconbridge,
In spite of spite, alone upholds the day.


PEMBROKE

They say King John sore sick hath left the field.
Enter MELUN, wounded


MELUN

Lead me to the revolts of England here.


SALISBURY

When we were happy we had other names.


PEMBROKE

It is the Count Melun.


SALISBURY

Wounded to death.


MELUN

Fly, noble English, you are bought and sold;
Unthread the rude eye of rebellion
And welcome home again discarded faith.
Seek out King John and fall before his feet;
For if the French be lords of this loud day,
He means to recompense the pains you take
By cutting off your heads: thus hath he sworn
And I with him, and many moe with me,
Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury;
Even on that altar where we swore to you
Dear amity and everlasting love.


SALISBURY

May this be possible? may this be true?


MELUN

Have I not hideous death within my view,
Retaining but a quantity of life,
Which bleeds away, even as a form of wax
Resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire?
What in the world should make me now deceive,
Since I must lose the use of all deceit?
Why should I then be false, since it is true
That I must die here and live hence by truth?
I say again, if Lewis do win the day,
He is forsworn, if e'er those eyes of yours
Behold another day break in the east:
But even this night, whose black contagious breath
Already smokes about the burning crest
Of the old, feeble and day-wearied sun,
Even this ill night, your breathing shall expire,
Paying the fine of rated treachery
Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives,
If Lewis by your assistance win the day.
Commend me to one Hubert with your king:
The love of him, and this respect besides,
For that my grandsire was an Englishman,
Awakes my conscience to confess all this.
In lieu whereof, I pray you, bear me hence
From forth the noise and rumour of the field,
Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts
In peace, and part this body and my soul
With contemplation and devout desires.


SALISBURY

We do believe thee: and beshrew my soul
But I do love the favour and the form
Of this most fair occasion, by the which
We will untread the steps of damned flight,
And like a bated and retired flood,
Leaving our rankness and irregular course,
Stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'd
And cabby run on in obedience
Even to our ocean, to our great King John.
My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence;
For I do see the cruel pangs of death
Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;
And happy newness, that intends old right.
Exeunt, leading off MELUN

SCENE V. The French camp.

Enter LEWIS and his train


LEWIS

The sun of heaven methought was loath to set,
But stay'd and made the western welkin blush,
When English measure backward their own ground
In faint retire. O, bravely came we off,
When with a volley of our needless shot,
After such bloody toil, we bid good night;
And wound our tattering colours clearly up,
Last in the field, and almost lords of it!
Enter a Messenger


Messenger

Where is my prince, the Dauphin?


LEWIS

Here: what news?


Messenger

The Count Melun is slain; the English lords
By his persuasion are again fall'n off,
And your supply, which you have wish'd so long,
Are cast away and sunk on Goodwin Sands.


LEWIS

Ah, foul shrewd news! beshrew thy very heart!
I did not think to be so sad to-night
As this hath made me. Who was he that said
King John did fly an hour or two before
The stumbling night did part our weary powers?


Messenger

Whoever spoke it, it is true, my lord.


LEWIS

Well; keep good quarter and good care to-night:
The day shall not be up so soon as I,
To try the fair adventure of to-morrow.
Exeunt

SCENE VI. An open place in the neighbourhood of Swinstead Abbey.

Enter the BASTARD and HUBERT, severally


HUBERT

Who's there? speak, ho! speak quickly, or I shoot.


BASTARD

A friend. What art thou?


HUBERT

Of the part of England.


BASTARD

Whither dost thou go?


HUBERT

What's that to thee? why may not I demand
Of thine affairs, as well as thou of mine?


BASTARD

Hubert, I think?


HUBERT

                  Thou hast a perfect thought:
I will upon all hazards well believe
Thou art my friend, that know'st my tongue so well.
Who art thou?


BASTARD

                  Who thou wilt: and if thou please,
Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think
I come one way of the Plantagenets.


HUBERT

Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night
Have done me shame: brave soldier, pardon me,
That any accent breaking from thy tongue
Should 'scape the true acquaintance of mine ear.


BASTARD

Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad?


HUBERT

Why, here walk I in the black brow of night,
To find you out.


BASTARD

                  Brief, then; and what's the news?


HUBERT

O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,
Black, fearful, comfortless and horrible.


BASTARD

Show me the very wound of this ill news:
I am no woman, I'll not swoon at it.


HUBERT

The king, I fear, is poison'd by a monk:
I left him almost speechless; and broke out
To acquaint you with this evil, that you might
The better arm you to the sudden time,
Than if you had at leisure known of this.


BASTARD

How did he take it? who did taste to him?


HUBERT

A monk, I tell you; a resolved villain,
Whose bowels suddenly burst out: the king
Yet speaks and peradventure may recover.


BASTARD

Who didst thou leave to tend his majesty?


HUBERT

Why, know you not? the lords are all come back,
And brought Prince Henry in their company;
At whose request the king hath pardon'd them,
And they are all about his majesty.


BASTARD

Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,
And tempt us not to bear above our power!
I'll tell tree, Hubert, half my power this night,
Passing these flats, are taken by the tide;
These Lincoln Washes have devoured them;
Myself, well mounted, hardly have escaped.
Away before: conduct me to the king;
I doubt he will be dead or ere I come.
Exeunt

SCENE VII. The orchard in Swinstead Abbey.

Enter PRINCE HENRY, SALISBURY, and BIGOT


PRINCE HENRY

It is too late: the life of all his blood
Is touch'd corruptibly, and his pure brain,
Which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house,
Doth by the idle comments that it makes
Foretell the ending of mortality.
Enter PEMBROKE


PEMBROKE

His highness yet doth speak, and holds belief
That, being brought into the open air,
It would allay the burning quality
Of that fell poison which assaileth him.


PRINCE HENRY

Let him be brought into the orchard here.
Doth he still rage?
Exit BIGOT


PEMBROKE

He is more patient
Than when you left him; even now he sung.


PRINCE HENRY

O vanity of sickness! fierce extremes
In their continuance will not feel themselves.
Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,
Leaves them invisible, and his siege is now
Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds
With many legions of strange fantasies,
Whi ch, in their throng and press to that last hold,
Confound themselves. 'Tis strange that death
should sing.
I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,
Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,
And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings
His soul and body to their lasting rest.


SALISBURY

Be of good comfort, prince; for you are born
To set a form upon that indigest
Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.
Enter Attendants, and BIGOT, carrying KING JOHN in a chair


KING JOHN

Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room;
It would not out at windows nor at doors.
There is so hot a summer in my bosom,
That all my bowels crumble up to dust:
I am a scribbled form, drawn with a pen
Upon a parchment, and against this fire
Do I shrink up.


PRINCE HENRY

                  How fares your majesty?


KING JOHN

Poison'd,--ill fare--dead, forsook, cast off:
And none of you will bid the winter come
To thrust his icy fingers in my maw,
Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course
Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north
To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips
And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much,
I beg cold comfort; and you are so strait
And so ingrateful, you deny me that.


PRINCE HENRY

O that there were some virtue in my tears,
That might relieve you!


KING JOHN

The salt in them is hot.
Within me is a hell; and there the poison
Is as a fiend confined to tyrannize
On unreprievable condemned blood.
Enter the BASTARD


BASTARD

O, I am scalded with my violent motion,
And spleen of speed to see your majesty!


KING JOHN

O cousin, thou art come to set mine eye:
The tackle of my heart is crack'd and burn'd,
And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail
Are turned to one thread, one little hair:
My heart hath one poor string to stay it by,
Which holds but till thy news be uttered;
And then all this thou seest is but a clod
And module of confounded royalty.


BASTARD

The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,
Where heaven He knows how we shall answer him;
For in a night the best part of my power,
As I upon advantage did remove,
Were in the Washes all unwarily
Devoured by the unexpected flood.
KING JOHN dies


SALISBURY

You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.
My liege! my lord! but now a king, now thus.


PRINCE HENRY

Even so must I run on, and even so stop.
What surety of the world, what hope, what stay,
When this was now a king, and now is clay?


BASTARD

Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind
To do the office for thee of revenge,
And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,
As it on earth hath been thy servant still.
Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,
Where be your powers? show now your mended faiths,
And instantly return with me again,
To push destruction and perpetual shame
Out of the weak door of our fainting land.
Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;
The Dauphin rages at our very heels.


SALISBURY

It seems you know not, then, so much as we:
The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest,
Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin,
And brings from him such offers of our peace
As we with honour and respect may take,
With purpose presently to leave this war.


BASTARD

He will the rather do it when he sees
Ourselves well sinewed to our defence.


SALISBURY

Nay, it is in a manner done already;
For many carriages he hath dispatch'd
To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel
To the disposing of the cardinal:
With whom yourself, myself and other lords,
If you think meet, this afternoon will post
To consummate this business happily.


BASTARD

Let it be so: and you, my noble prince,
With other princes that may best be spared,
Shall wait upon your father's funeral.


PRINCE HENRY

At Worcester must his body be interr'd;
For so he will'd it.


BASTARD

Thither shall it then:
And happily may your sweet self put on
The lineal state and glory of the land!
To whom with all submission, on my knee
I do bequeath my faithful services
And true subjection everlastingly.


SALISBURY

And the like tender of our love we make,
To rest without a spot for evermore.


PRINCE HENRY

I have a kind soul that would give you thanks
And knows not how to do it but with tears.


BASTARD

O, let us pay the time but needful woe,
Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.
This England never did, nor never shall,
Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,
But when it first did help to wound itself.
Now these her princes are come home again,
Come the three corners of the world in arms,
And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue,
If England to itself do rest but true.
Exeunt




The Life and Death of Julies Caesar

ACT I
SCENE I. Rome. A street.

Enter FLAVIUS, MARULLUS, and certain Commoners


FLAVIUS

Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home:
Is this a holiday? what! know you not,
Being mechanical, you ought not walk
Upon a labouring day without the sign
Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?


First Commoner

Why, sir, a carpenter.


MARULLUS

Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
What dost thou with thy best apparel on?
You, sir, what trade are you?


Second Commoner

Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,
as you would say, a cobbler.


MARULLUS

But what trade art thou? answer me directly.


Second Commoner

A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe
conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.


MARULLUS

What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?


Second Commoner

Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet,
if you be out, sir, I can mend you.


MARULLUS

What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!


Second Commoner

Why, sir, cobble you.


FLAVIUS

Thou art a cobbler, art thou?


Second Commoner

Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I
meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's
matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon
to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I
recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon
neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.


FLAVIUS

But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?


Second Commoner

Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself
into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday,
to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.


MARULLUS

Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?
What tributaries follow him to Rome,
To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?
You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft
Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,
To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,
Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
The livelong day, with patient expectation,
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:
And when you saw his chariot but appear,
Have you not made an universal shout,
That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
To hear the replication of your sounds
Made in her concave shores?
And do you now put on your best attire?
And do you now cull out a holiday?
And do you now strew flowers in his way
That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!
Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
That needs must light on this ingratitude.


FLAVIUS

Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,
Assemble all the poor men of your sort;
Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears
Into the channel, till the lowest stream
Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.
Exeunt all the Commoners
See whether their basest metal be not moved;
They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.
Go you down that way towards the Capitol;


This way will I

disrobe the images,
If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.


MARULLUS

May we do so?
You know it is the feast of Lupercal.


FLAVIUS

It is no matter; let no images
Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,
And drive away the vulgar from the streets:
So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing
Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,
Who else would soar above the view of men
And keep us all in servile fearfulness.
Exeunt

SCENE II. A public place.

Flourish. Enter CAESAR; ANTONY, for the course;  CALPURNIA, PORTIA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CICERO, BRUTUS,  CASSIUS, and CASCA; a great crowd following, among them a Soothsayer


CAESAR

Calpurnia!


CASCA

         Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.


CAESAR

Calpurnia!


CALPURNIA

Here, my lord.


CAESAR

Stand you directly in Antonius' way,
When he doth run his course. Antonius!


ANTONY

Caesar, my lord?


CAESAR

Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,
To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,
The barren, touched in this holy chase,
Shake off their sterile curse.


ANTONY

I shall remember:
When Caesar says 'do this,' it is perform'd.


CAESAR

Set on; and leave no ceremony out.
Flourish


Soothsayer

Caesar!


CAESAR

Ha! who calls?


CASCA

Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!


CAESAR

Who is it in the press that calls on me?
I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,
Cry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear.


Soothsayer

Beware the ides of March.


CAESAR

What man is that?


BRUTUS

A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.


CAESAR

Set him before me; let me see his face.


CASSIUS

Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.


CAESAR

What say'st thou to me now? speak once again.


Soothsayer

Beware the ides of March.


CAESAR

He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.
Sennet. Exeunt all except BRUTUS and CASSIUS


CASSIUS

Will you go see the order of the course?


BRUTUS

Not I.


CASSIUS

I pray you, do.


BRUTUS

I am not gamesome: I do lack some part
Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;
I'll leave you.


CASSIUS

Brutus, I do observe you now of late:
I have not from your eyes that gentleness
And show of love as I was wont to have:
You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
Over your friend that loves you.


BRUTUS

Cassius,
Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,
I turn the trouble of my countenance
Merely upon myself. Vexed I am
Of late with passions of some difference,
Conceptions only proper to myself,
Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;
But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--
Among which number, Cassius, be you one--
Nor construe any further my neglect,
Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,
Forgets the shows of love to other men.


CASSIUS

Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;
By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?


BRUTUS

No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,
But by reflection, by some other things.


CASSIUS

'Tis just:
And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
That you have no such mirrors as will turn
Your hidden worthiness into your eye,
That you might see your shadow. I have heard,
Where many of the best respect in Rome,
Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus
And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.


BRUTUS

Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
That you would have me seek into myself
For that which is not in me?


CASSIUS

Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:
And since you know you cannot see yourself
So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
Will modestly discover to yourself
That of yourself which you yet know not of.
And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:
Were I a common laugher, or did use
To stale with ordinary oaths my love
To every new protester; if you know
That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
And after scandal them, or if you know
That I profess myself in banqueting
To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.
Flourish, and shout


BRUTUS

What means this shouting? I do fear, the people
Choose Caesar for their king.


CASSIUS

Ay, do you fear it?
Then must I think you would not have it so.


BRUTUS

I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.
But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
What is it that you would impart to me?
If it be aught toward the general good,
Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,
And I will look on both indifferently,
For let the gods so speed me as I love
The name of honour more than I fear death.


CASSIUS

I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
As well as I do know your outward favour.
Well, honour is the subject of my story.
I cannot tell what you and other men
Think of this life; but, for my single self,
I had as lief not be as live to be
In awe of such a thing as I myself.
I was born free as Caesar; so were you:
We both have fed as well, and we can both
Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
For once, upon a raw and gusty day,
The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now
Leap in with me into this angry flood,
And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,
Accoutred as I was, I plunged in
And bade him follow; so indeed he did.
The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it
With lusty sinews, throwing it aside
And stemming it with hearts of controversy;
But ere we could arrive the point proposed,
Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'
I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,
Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber
Did I the tired Caesar. And this man
Is now become a god, and Cassius is
A wretched creature and must bend his body,
If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
He had a fever when he was in Spain,
And when the fit was on him, I did mark
How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;
His coward lips did from their colour fly,
And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:
Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
Mark him and write his speeches in their books,
Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'
As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me
A man of such a feeble temper should
So get the start of the majestic world
And bear the palm alone.
Shout. Flourish


BRUTUS

Another general shout!
I do believe that these applauses are
For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.


CASSIUS

Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
Like a Colossus, and we petty men
Walk under his huge legs and peep about
To find ourselves dishonourable graves.
Men at some time are masters of their fates:
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?
Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
Write them together, yours is as fair a name;
Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,
Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.
Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,
That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
When went there by an age, since the great flood,
But it was famed with more than with one man?
When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,
That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?
Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,
When there is in it but one only man.
O, you and I have heard our fathers say,
There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd
The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
As easily as a king.


BRUTUS

That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
What you would work me to, I have some aim:
How I have thought of this and of these times,
I shall recount hereafter; for this present,
I would not, so with love I might entreat you,
Be any further moved. What you have said
I will consider; what you have to say
I will with patience hear, and find a time
Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:
Brutus had rather be a villager
Than to repute himself a son of Rome
Under these hard conditions as this time
Is like to lay upon us.


CASSIUS

I am glad that my weak words
Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.


BRUTUS

The games are done and Caesar is returning.


CASSIUS

As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;
And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you
What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.
Re-enter CAESAR and his Train


BRUTUS

I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,
And all the rest look like a chidden train:
Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero
Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
As we have seen him in the Capitol,
Being cross'd in conference by some senators.


CASSIUS

Casca will tell us what the matter is.


CAESAR

Antonius!


ANTONY

Caesar?


CAESAR

Let me have men about me that are fat;
Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:
Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.


ANTONY

Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
He is a noble Roman and well given.


CAESAR

Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:
Yet if my name were liable to fear,
I do not know the man I should avoid
So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;
He is a great observer and he looks
Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,
As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;
Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit
That could be moved to smile at any thing.
Such men as he be never at heart's ease
Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,
And therefore are they very dangerous.
I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd
Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.
Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,
And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.
Sennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train, but CASCA


CASCA

You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?


BRUTUS

Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,
That Caesar looks so sad.


CASCA

Why, you were with him, were you not?


BRUTUS

I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.


CASCA

Why, there was a crown offered him: and being
offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,
thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.


BRUTUS

What was the second noise for?


CASCA

Why, for that too.


CASSIUS

They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?


CASCA

Why, for that too.


BRUTUS

Was the crown offered him thrice?


CASCA

Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every
time gentler than other, and at every putting-by
mine honest neighbours shouted.


CASSIUS

Who offered him the crown?


CASCA

Why, Antony.


BRUTUS

Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.


CASCA

I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:
it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark
Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown
neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told
you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my
thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he
offered it to him again; then he put it by again:
but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his
fingers off it. And then he offered it the third
time; he put it the third time by: and still as he
refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their
chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps
and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because
Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked
Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and
for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of
opening my lips and receiving the bad air.


CASSIUS

But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?


CASCA

He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at
mouth, and was speechless.


BRUTUS

'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.


CASSIUS

No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,
And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.


CASCA

I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,
Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not
clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and
displeased them, as they use to do the players in
the theatre, I am no true man.


BRUTUS

What said he when he came unto himself?


CASCA

Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the
common herd was glad he refused the crown, he
plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his
throat to cut. An I had been a man of any
occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,
I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so
he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,
If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired
their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three
or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good
soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but
there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had
stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.


BRUTUS

And after that, he came, thus sad, away?


CASCA

Ay.


CASSIUS

Did Cicero say any thing?


CASCA

Ay, he spoke Greek.


CASSIUS

To what effect?


CASCA

Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the
face again: but those that understood him smiled at
one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own
part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more
news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs
off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you
well. There was more foolery yet, if I could
remember it.


CASSIUS

Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?


CASCA

No, I am promised forth.


CASSIUS

Will you dine with me to-morrow?


CASCA

Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner
worth the eating.


CASSIUS

Good: I will expect you.


CASCA

Do so. Farewell, both.
Exit


BRUTUS

What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
He was quick mettle when he went to school.


CASSIUS

So is he now in execution
Of any bold or noble enterprise,
However he puts on this tardy form.
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,
Which gives men stomach to digest his words
With better appetite.


BRUTUS

And so it is. For this time I will leave you:
To-morrow, if you please to speak with me,
I will come home to you; or, if you will,
Come home to me, and I will wait for you.


CASSIUS

I will do so: till then, think of the world.
Exit BRUTUS
Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,
Thy honourable metal may be wrought
From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet
That noble minds keep ever with their likes;
For who so firm that cannot be seduced?
Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:
If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,
He should not humour me. I will this night,
In several hands, in at his windows throw,
As if they came from several citizens,
Writings all tending to the great opinion
That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely
Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at:
And after this let Caesar seat him sure;
For we will shake him, or worse days endure.
Exit

SCENE III. The same. A street.

Thunder and lightning. Enter from opposite sides, CASCA, with his sword drawn, and CICERO


CICERO

Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?
Why are you breathless? and why stare you so?


CASCA

Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,
I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds
Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen
The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,
To be exalted with the threatening clouds:
But never till to-night, never till now,
Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
Either there is a civil strife in heaven,
Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
Incenses them to send destruction.


CICERO

Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?


CASCA

A common slave--you know him well by sight--
Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn
Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand,
Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.
Besides--I ha' not since put up my sword--
Against the Capitol I met a lion,
Who glared upon me, and went surly by,
Without annoying me: and there were drawn
Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,
Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw
Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.
And yesterday the bird of night did sit
Even at noon-day upon the market-place,
Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies
Do so conjointly meet, let not men say
'These are their reasons; they are natural;'
For, I believe, they are portentous things
Unto the climate that they point upon.


CICERO

Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time:
But men may construe things after their fashion,
Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?


CASCA

He doth; for he did bid Antonius
Send word to you he would be there to-morrow.


CICERO

Good night then, Casca: this disturbed sky
Is not to walk in.


CASCA

Farewell, Cicero.
Exit CICERO
Enter CASSIUS


CASSIUS

Who's there?


CASCA

                  A Roman.


CASSIUS

Casca, by your voice.


CASCA

Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!


CASSIUS

A very pleasing night to honest men.


CASCA

Who ever knew the heavens menace so?


CASSIUS

Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,
Submitting me unto the perilous night,
And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,
Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;
And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open
The breast of heaven, I did present myself
Even in the aim and very flash of it.


CASCA

But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
It is the part of men to fear and tremble,
When the most mighty gods by tokens send
Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.


CASSIUS

You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
That should be in a Roman you do want,
Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze
And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,
To see the strange impatience of the heavens:
But if you would consider the true cause
Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,
Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,
Why old men fool and children calculate,
Why all these things change from their ordinance
Their natures and preformed faculties
To monstrous quality,--why, you shall find
That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,
To make them instruments of fear and warning
Unto some monstrous state.
Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man
Most like this dreadful night,
That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
As doth the lion in the Capitol,
A man no mightier than thyself or me
In personal action, yet prodigious grown
And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.


CASCA

'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?


CASSIUS

Let it be who it is: for Romans now
Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;
But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,
And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;
Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.


CASCA

Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow
Mean to establish Caesar as a king;
And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,
In every place, save here in Italy.


CASSIUS

I know where I will wear this dagger then;
Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:
Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;
Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:
Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,
Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,
Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;
But life, being weary of these worldly bars,
Never lacks power to dismiss itself.
If I know this, know all the world besides,
That part of tyranny that I do bear
I can shake off at pleasure.
Thunder still


CASCA

So can I:
So every bondman in his own hand bears
The power to cancel his captivity.


CASSIUS

And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,
But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:
He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,
What rubbish and what offal, when it serves
For the base matter to illuminate
So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,
Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this
Before a willing bondman; then I know
My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,
And dangers are to me indifferent.


CASCA

You speak to Casca, and to such a man
That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:
Be factious for redress of all these griefs,
And I will set this foot of mine as far
As who goes farthest.


CASSIUS

There's a bargain made.
Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
To undergo with me an enterprise
Of honourable-dangerous consequence;
And I do know, by this, they stay for me
In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,
There is no stir or walking in the streets;
And the complexion of the element
In favour's like the work we have in hand,
Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.


CASCA

Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.


CASSIUS

'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;
He is a friend.
Enter CINNA
Cinna, where haste you so?


CINNA

To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?


CASSIUS

No, it is Casca; one incorporate
To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?


CINNA

I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this!
There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.


CASSIUS

Am I not stay'd for? tell me.


CINNA

Yes, you are.
O Cassius, if you could
But win the noble Brutus to our party--


CASSIUS

Be you content: good Cinna, take this paper,
And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,
Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this
In at his window; set this up with wax
Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,
Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us.
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?


CINNA

All but Metellus Cimber; and he's gone
To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,
And so bestow these papers as you bade me.


CASSIUS

That done, repair to Pompey's theatre.
Exit CINNA
Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day
See Brutus at his house: three parts of him
Is ours already, and the man entire
Upon the next encounter yields him ours.


CASCA

O, he sits high in all the people's hearts:
And that which would appear offence in us,
His countenance, like richest alchemy,
Will change to virtue and to worthiness.


CASSIUS

Him and his worth and our great need of him
You have right well conceited. Let us go,
For it is after midnight; and ere day
We will awake him and be sure of him.
Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. Rome. BRUTUS's orchard.

Enter BRUTUS


BRUTUS

What, Lucius, ho!
I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!
I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
When, Lucius, when? awake, I say! what, Lucius!
Enter LUCIUS


LUCIUS

Call'd you, my lord?


BRUTUS

Get me a taper in my study, Lucius:
When it is lighted, come and call me here.


LUCIUS

I will, my lord.
Exit


BRUTUS

It must be by his death: and for my part,
I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
But for the general. He would be crown'd:
How that might change his nature, there's the question.
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;
And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;--
And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,
That at his will he may do danger with.
The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins
Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,
I have not known when his affections sway'd
More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,
That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
But when he once attains the upmost round.
He then unto the ladder turns his back,
Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.
Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
Will bear no colour for the thing he is,
Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,
Would run to these and these extremities:
And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,
And kill him in the shell.
Re-enter LUCIUS


LUCIUS

The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
Searching the window for a flint, I found
This paper, thus seal'd up; and, I am sure,
It did not lie there when I went to bed.
Gives him the letter


BRUTUS

Get you to bed again; it is not day.
Is not to-morrow, boy, the ides of March?


LUCIUS

I know not, sir.


BRUTUS

Look in the calendar, and bring me word.


LUCIUS

I will, sir.
Exit


BRUTUS

The exhalations whizzing in the air
Give so much light that I may read by them.
Opens the letter and reads
'Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake, and see thyself.
Shall Rome,  & c. Speak, strike, redress!
Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!'
Such instigations have been often dropp'd
Where I have took them up.
'Shall Rome,  & c.' Thus must I piece it out:
Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
'Speak, strike, redress!' Am I entreated
To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise:
If the redress will follow, thou receivest
Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
Re-enter LUCIUS


LUCIUS

Sir, March is wasted fourteen days.
Knocking within


BRUTUS

'Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks.
Exit LUCIUS
Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,
I have not slept.
Between the acting of a dreadful thing
And the first motion, all the interim is
Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream:
The Genius and the mortal instruments
Are then in council; and the state of man,
Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
The nature of an insurrection.
Re-enter LUCIUS


LUCIUS

Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
Who doth desire to see you.


BRUTUS

Is he alone?


LUCIUS

No, sir, there are moe with him.


BRUTUS

Do you know them?


LUCIUS

No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
And half their faces buried in their cloaks,
That by no means I may discover them
By any mark of favour.


BRUTUS

Let 'em enter.
Exit LUCIUS
They are the faction. O conspiracy,
Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,
When evils are most free? O, then by day
Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy;
Hide it in smiles and affability:
For if thou path, thy native semblance on,
Not Erebus itself were dim enough
To hide thee from prevention.
Enter the conspirators, CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CINNA, METELLUS CIMBER, and TREBONIUS


CASSIUS

I think we are too bold upon your rest:
Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?


BRUTUS

I have been up this hour, awake all night.
Know I these men that come along with you?


CASSIUS

Yes, every man of them, and no man here
But honours you; and every one doth wish
You had but that opinion of yourself
Which every noble Roman bears of you.
This is Trebonius.


BRUTUS

                  He is welcome hither.


CASSIUS

This, Decius Brutus.


BRUTUS

He is welcome too.


CASSIUS

This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.


BRUTUS

They are all welcome.
What watchful cares do interpose themselves
Betwixt your eyes and night?


CASSIUS

Shall I entreat a word?
BRUTUS and CASSIUS whisper


DECIUS BRUTUS

Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?


CASCA

No.


CINNA

O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines
That fret the clouds are messengers of day.


CASCA

You shall confess that you are both deceived.
Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,
Which is a great way growing on the south,
Weighing the youthful season of the year.
Some two months hence up higher toward the north
He first presents his fire; and the high east
Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.


BRUTUS

Give me your hands all over, one by one.


CASSIUS

And let us swear our resolution.


BRUTUS

No, not an oath: if not the face of men,
The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,--
If these be motives weak, break off betimes,
And every man hence to his idle bed;
So let high-sighted tyranny range on,
Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,
As I am sure they do, bear fire enough
To kindle cowards and to steel with valour
The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,
What need we any spur but our own cause,
To prick us to redress? what other bond
Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,
And will not palter? and what other oath
Than honesty to honesty engaged,
That this shall be, or we will fall for it?
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,
Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear
Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain
The even virtue of our enterprise,
Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,
To think that or our cause or our performance
Did need an oath; when every drop of blood
That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,
Is guilty of a several bastardy,
If he do break the smallest particle
Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.


CASSIUS

But what of Cicero? shall we sound him?
I think he will stand very strong with us.


CASCA

Let us not leave him out.


CINNA

No, by no means.


METELLUS CIMBER

O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
Will purchase us a good opinion
And buy men's voices to commend our deeds:
It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands;
Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,
But all be buried in his gravity.


BRUTUS

O, name him not: let us not break with him;
For he will never follow any thing
That other men begin.


CASSIUS

Then leave him out.


CASCA

Indeed he is not fit.


DECIUS BRUTUS

Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?


CASSIUS

Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,
Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,
Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him
A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,
If he improve them, may well stretch so far
As to annoy us all: which to prevent,
Let Antony and Caesar fall together.


BRUTUS

Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,
Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;
For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:
Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;
And in the spirit of men there is no blood:
O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,
And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,
Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,
Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;
Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:
And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,
Stir up their servants to an act of rage,
And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make
Our purpose necessary and not envious:
Which so appearing to the common eyes,
We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.
And for Mark Antony, think not of him;
For he can do no more than Caesar's arm
When Caesar's head is off.


CASSIUS

Yet I fear him;
For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar--


BRUTUS

Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:
If he love Caesar, all that he can do
Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar:
And that were much he should; for he is given
To sports, to wildness and much company.


TREBONIUS

There is no fear in him; let him not die;
For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.
Clock strikes


BRUTUS

Peace! count the clock.


CASSIUS

The clock hath stricken three.


TREBONIUS

'Tis time to part.


CASSIUS

                  But it is doubtful yet,
Whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no;
For he is superstitious grown of late,
Quite from the main opinion he held once
Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies:
It may be, these apparent prodigies,
The unaccustom'd terror of this night,
And the persuasion of his augurers,
May hold him from the Capitol to-day.


DECIUS BRUTUS

Never fear that: if he be so resolved,
I can o'ersway him; for he loves to hear
That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,
And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
Lions with toils and men with flatterers;
But when I tell him he hates flatterers,
He says he does, being then most flattered.
Let me work;
For I can give his humour the true bent,
And I will bring him to the Capitol.


CASSIUS

Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.


BRUTUS

By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?


CINNA

Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.


METELLUS CIMBER

Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,
Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey:
I wonder none of you have thought of him.


BRUTUS

Now, good Metellus, go along by him:
He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;
Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.


CASSIUS

The morning comes upon 's: we'll leave you, Brutus.
And, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember
What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.


BRUTUS

Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
Let not our looks put on our purposes,
But bear it as our Roman actors do,
With untired spirits and formal constancy:
And so good morrow to you every one.
Exeunt all but BRUTUS
Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;
Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:
Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,
Which busy care draws in the brains of men;
Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.
Enter PORTIA


PORTIA

Brutus, my lord!


BRUTUS

Portia, what mean you? wherefore rise you now?
It is not for your health thus to commit
Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.


PORTIA

Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,
Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,
You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,
Musing and sighing, with your arms across,
And when I ask'd you what the matter was,
You stared upon me with ungentle looks;
I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,
And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot;
Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,
But, with an angry wafture of your hand,
Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;
Fearing to strengthen that impatience
Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal
Hoping it was but an effect of humour,
Which sometime hath his hour with every man.
It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,
And could it work so much upon your shape
As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,
I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,
Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.


BRUTUS

I am not well in health, and that is all.


PORTIA

Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,
He would embrace the means to come by it.


BRUTUS

Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.


PORTIA

Is Brutus sick? and is it physical
To walk unbraced and suck up the humours
Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,
And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,
To dare the vile contagion of the night
And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;
You have some sick offence within your mind,
Which, by the right and virtue of my place,
I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,
I charm you, by my once-commended beauty,
By all your vows of love and that great vow
Which did incorporate and make us one,
That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,
Why you are heavy, and what men to-night
Have had to resort to you: for here have been
Some six or seven, who did hide their faces
Even from darkness.


BRUTUS

Kneel not, gentle Portia.


PORTIA

I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,
Is it excepted I should know no secrets
That appertain to you? Am I yourself
But, as it were, in sort or limitation,
To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,
And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs
Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,
Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.


BRUTUS

You are my true and honourable wife,
As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
That visit my sad heart


PORTIA

If this were true, then should I know this secret.
I grant I am a woman; but withal
A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife:
I grant I am a woman; but withal
A woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter.
Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
Being so father'd and so husbanded?
Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em:
I have made strong proof of my constancy,
Giving myself a voluntary wound
Here, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience.
And not my husband's secrets?


BRUTUS

O ye gods,
Render me worthy of this noble wife!
Knocking within
Hark, hark! one knocks: Portia, go in awhile;
And by and by thy bosom shall partake
The secrets of my heart.
All my engagements I will construe to thee,
All the charactery of my sad brows:
Leave me with haste.
Exit PORTIA
Lucius, who's that knocks?
Re-enter LUCIUS with LIGARIUS


LUCIUS

He is a sick man that would speak with you.


BRUTUS

Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.
Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius! how?


LIGARIUS

Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.


BRUTUS

O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,
To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!


LIGARIUS

I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand
Any exploit worthy the name of honour.


BRUTUS

Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,
Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.


LIGARIUS

By all the gods that Romans bow before,
I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!
Brave son, derived from honourable loins!
Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up
My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,
And I will strive with things impossible;
Yea, get the better of them. What's to do?


BRUTUS

A piece of work that will make sick men whole.


LIGARIUS

But are not some whole that we must make sick?


BRUTUS

That must we also. What it is, my Caius,
I shall unfold to thee, as we are going
To whom it must be done.


LIGARIUS

Set on your foot,
And with a heart new-fired I follow you,
To do I know not what: but it sufficeth
That Brutus leads me on.


BRUTUS

Follow me, then.
Exeunt

SCENE II. CAESAR's house.

Thunder and lightning. Enter CAESAR, in his night-gown


CAESAR

Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night:
Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,
'Help, ho! they murder Caesar!' Who's within?
Enter a Servant


Servant

My lord?


CAESAR

Go bid the priests do present sacrifice
And bring me their opinions of success.


Servant

I will, my lord.
Exit
Enter CALPURNIA


CALPURNIA

What mean you, Caesar? think you to walk forth?
You shall not stir out of your house to-day.


CAESAR

Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me
Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see
The face of Caesar, they are vanished.


CALPURNIA

Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,
Yet now they fright me. There is one within,
Besides the things that we have heard and seen,
Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
A lioness hath whelped in the streets;
And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead;
Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,
In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,
Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;
The noise of battle hurtled in the air,
Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,
And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.
O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,
And I do fear them.


CAESAR

What can be avoided
Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?
Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions
Are to the world in general as to Caesar.


CALPURNIA

When beggars die, there are no comets seen;
The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.


CAESAR

Cowards die many times before their deaths;
The valiant never taste of death but once.
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.
It seems to me most strange that men should fear;
Seeing that death, a necessary end,
Will come when it will come.
Re-enter Servant
What say the augurers?


Servant

They would not have you to stir forth to-day.
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,
They could not find a heart within the beast.


CAESAR

The gods do this in shame of cowardice:
Caesar should be a beast without a heart,
If he should stay at home to-day for fear.
No, Caesar shall not: danger knows full well
That Caesar is more dangerous than he:
We are two lions litter'd in one day,
And I the elder and more terrible:
And Caesar shall go forth.


CALPURNIA

Alas, my lord,
Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.
Do not go forth to-day: call it my fear
That keeps you in the house, and not your own.
We'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house:
And he shall say you are not well to-day:
Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.


CAESAR

Mark Antony shall say I am not well,
And, for thy humour, I will stay at home.
Enter DECIUS BRUTUS
Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.


DECIUS BRUTUS

Caesar, all hail! good morrow, worthy Caesar:
I come to fetch you to the senate-house.


CAESAR

And you are come in very happy time,
To bear my greeting to the senators
And tell them that I will not come to-day:
Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:
I will not come to-day: tell them so, Decius.


CALPURNIA

Say he is sick.


CAESAR

                  Shall Caesar send a lie?
Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,
To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?
Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.


DECIUS BRUTUS

Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,
Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.


CAESAR

The cause is in my will: I will not come;
That is enough to satisfy the senate.
But for your private satisfaction,
Because I love you, I will let you know:
Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:
She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,
Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,
Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans
Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it:
And these does she apply for warnings, and portents,
And evils imminent; and on her knee
Hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.


DECIUS BRUTUS

This dream is all amiss interpreted;
It was a vision fair and fortunate:
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,
In which so many smiling Romans bathed,
Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
For tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.
This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.


CAESAR

And this way have you well expounded it.


DECIUS BRUTUS

I have, when you have heard what I can say:
And know it now: the senate have concluded
To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.
If you shall send them word you will not come,
Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock
Apt to be render'd, for some one to say
'Break up the senate till another time,
When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.'
If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper
'Lo, Caesar is afraid'?
Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love
To our proceeding bids me tell you this;
And reason to my love is liable.


CAESAR

How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!
I am ashamed I did yield to them.
Give me my robe, for I will go.
Enter PUBLIUS, BRUTUS, LIGARIUS, METELLUS, CASCA, TREBONIUS, and CINNA
And look where Publius is come to fetch me.


PUBLIUS

Good morrow, Caesar.


CAESAR

Welcome, Publius.
What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?
Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,
Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy
As that same ague which hath made you lean.
What is 't o'clock?


BRUTUS

Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.


CAESAR

I thank you for your pains and courtesy.
Enter ANTONY
See! Antony, that revels long o' nights,
Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony.


ANTONY

So to most noble Caesar.


CAESAR

Bid them prepare within:
I am to blame to be thus waited for.
Now, Cinna: now, Metellus: what, Trebonius!
I have an hour's talk in store for you;
Remember that you call on me to-day:
Be near me, that I may remember you.


TREBONIUS

Caesar, I will:
Aside
and so near will I be,
That your best friends shall wish I had been further.


CAESAR

Good friends, go in, and taste some wine with me;
And we, like friends, will straightway go together.


BRUTUS

[Aside]  That every like is not the same, O Caesar,
The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon!
Exeunt

SCENE III. A street near the Capitol.

Enter ARTEMIDORUS, reading a paper


ARTEMIDORUS

'Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius;
come not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna, trust not
Trebonius: mark well Metellus Cimber: Decius Brutus
loves thee not: thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius.
There is but one mind in all these men, and it is
bent against Caesar. If thou beest not immortal,
look about you: security gives way to conspiracy.
The mighty gods defend thee! Thy lover,
'ARTEMIDORUS.'
Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,
And as a suitor will I give him this.
My heart laments that virtue cannot live
Out of the teeth of emulation.
If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayst live;
If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.
Exit

SCENE IV. Another part of the same street, before the house of BRUTUS.

Enter PORTIA and LUCIUS


PORTIA

I prithee, boy, run to the senate-house;
Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone:
Why dost thou stay?


LUCIUS

To know my errand, madam.


PORTIA

I would have had thee there, and here again,
Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
O constancy, be strong upon my side,
Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!
I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.
How hard it is for women to keep counsel!
Art thou here yet?


LUCIUS

                  Madam, what should I do?
Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?
And so return to you, and nothing else?


PORTIA

Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,
For he went sickly forth: and take good note
What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.
Hark, boy! what noise is that?


LUCIUS

I hear none, madam.


PORTIA

Prithee, listen well;
I heard a bustling rumour, like a fray,
And the wind brings it from the Capitol.


LUCIUS

Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.
Enter the Soothsayer


PORTIA

Come hither, fellow: which way hast thou been?


Soothsayer

At mine own house, good lady.


PORTIA

What is't o'clock?


Soothsayer

                  About the ninth hour, lady.


PORTIA

Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?


Soothsayer

Madam, not yet: I go to take my stand,
To see him pass on to the Capitol.


PORTIA

Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?


Soothsayer

That I have, lady: if it will please Caesar
To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,
I shall beseech him to befriend himself.


PORTIA

Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?


Soothsayer

None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.
Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow:
The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,
Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,
Will crowd a feeble man almost to death:
I'll get me to a place more void, and there
Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.
Exit


PORTIA

I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing
The heart of woman is! O Brutus,
The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!
Sure, the boy heard me: Brutus hath a suit
That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint.
Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
Say I am merry: come to me again,
And bring me word what he doth say to thee.
Exeunt severally

ACT III
SCENE I. Rome. Before the Capitol; the Senate sitting above.

A crowd of people; among them ARTEMIDORUS and the  Soothsayer. Flourish. Enter CAESAR, BRUTUS,  CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS BRUTUS, METELLUS CIMBER,  TREBONIUS, CINNA, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POPILIUS, PUBLIUS, and others


CAESAR

[To the Soothsayer]  The ides of March are come.


Soothsayer

Ay, Caesar; but not gone.


ARTEMIDORUS

Hail, Caesar! read this schedule.


DECIUS BRUTUS

Trebonius doth desire you to o'erread,
At your best leisure, this his humble suit.


ARTEMIDORUS

O Caesar, read mine first; for mine's a suit
That touches Caesar nearer: read it, great Caesar.


CAESAR

What touches us ourself shall be last served.


ARTEMIDORUS

Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.


CAESAR

What, is the fellow mad?


PUBLIUS

Sirrah, give place.


CASSIUS

What, urge you your petitions in the street?
Come to the Capitol.
CAESAR goes up to the Senate-House, the rest following


POPILIUS

I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive.


CASSIUS

What enterprise, Popilius?


POPILIUS

Fare you well.
Advances to CAESAR


BRUTUS

What said Popilius Lena?


CASSIUS

He wish'd to-day our enterprise might thrive.
I fear our purpose is discovered.


BRUTUS

Look, how he makes to Caesar; mark him.


CASSIUS

Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.
Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,
Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,
For I will slay myself.


BRUTUS

Cassius, be constant:
Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;
For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.


CASSIUS

Trebonius knows his time; for, look you, Brutus.
He draws Mark Antony out of the way.
Exeunt ANTONY and TREBONIUS


DECIUS BRUTUS

Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,
And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.


BRUTUS

He is address'd: press near and second him.


CINNA

Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.


CAESAR

Are we all ready? What is now amiss
That Caesar and his senate must redress?


METELLUS CIMBER

Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,
Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat
An humble heart,--
Kneeling


CAESAR

                  I must prevent thee, Cimber.
These couchings and these lowly courtesies
Might fire the blood of ordinary men,
And turn pre-ordinance and first decree
Into the law of children. Be not fond,
To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood
That will be thaw'd from the true quality
With that which melteth fools; I mean, sweet words,
Low-crooked court'sies and base spaniel-fawning.
Thy brother by decree is banished:
If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,
I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.
Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause
Will he be satisfied.


METELLUS CIMBER

Is there no voice more worthy than my own
To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear
For the repealing of my banish'd brother?


BRUTUS

I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar;
Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may
Have an immediate freedom of repeal.


CAESAR

What, Brutus!


CASSIUS

                  Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon:
As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,
To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.


CASSIUS

I could be well moved, if I were as you:
If I could pray to move, prayers would move me:
But I am constant as the northern star,
Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality
There is no fellow in the firmament.
The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks,
They are all fire and every one doth shine,
But there's but one in all doth hold his place:
So in the world; 'tis furnish'd well with men,
And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;
Yet in the number I do know but one
That unassailable holds on his rank,
Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,
Let me a little show it, even in this;
That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,
And constant do remain to keep him so.


CINNA

O Caesar,--


CAESAR

          Hence! wilt thou lift up Olympus?


DECIUS BRUTUS

Great Caesar,--


CAESAR

                  Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?


CASCA

Speak, hands for me!
CASCA first, then the other Conspirators and BRUTUS stab CAESAR


CAESAR

Et tu, Brute! Then fall, Caesar.
Dies


CINNA

Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!
Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.


CASSIUS

Some to the common pulpits, and cry out
'Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!'


BRUTUS

People and senators, be not affrighted;
Fly not; stand stiff: ambition's debt is paid.


CASCA

Go to the pulpit, Brutus.


DECIUS BRUTUS

And Cassius too.


BRUTUS

Where's Publius?


CINNA

Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.


METELLUS CIMBER

Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar's
Should chance--


BRUTUS

Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer;
There is no harm intended to your person,
Nor to no Roman else: so tell them, Publius.


CASSIUS

And leave us, Publius; lest that the people,
Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.


BRUTUS

Do so: and let no man abide this deed,
But we the doers.
Re-enter TREBONIUS


CASSIUS

                  Where is Antony?


TREBONIUS

Fled to his house amazed:
Men, wives and children stare, cry out and run
As it were doomsday.


BRUTUS

Fates, we will know your pleasures:
That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time
And drawing days out, that men stand upon.


CASSIUS

Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life
Cuts off so many years of fearing death.


BRUTUS

Grant that, and then is death a benefit:
So are we Caesar's friends, that have abridged
His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,
And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood
Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords:
Then walk we forth, even to the market-place,
And, waving our red weapons o'er our heads,
Let's all cry 'Peace, freedom and liberty!'


CASSIUS

Stoop, then, and wash. How many ages hence
Shall this our lofty scene be acted over
In states unborn and accents yet unknown!


BRUTUS

How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,
That now on Pompey's basis lies along
No worthier than the dust!


CASSIUS

So oft as that shall be,
So often shall the knot of us be call'd
The men that gave their country liberty.


DECIUS BRUTUS

What, shall we forth?


CASSIUS

Ay, every man away:
Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels
With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.
Enter a Servant


BRUTUS

Soft! who comes here? A friend of Antony's.


Servant

Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel:
Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;
And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:
Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;
Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving:
Say I love Brutus, and I honour him;
Say I fear'd Caesar, honour'd him and loved him.
If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
May safely come to him, and be resolved
How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,
Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
So well as Brutus living; but will follow
The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
Thorough the hazards of this untrod state
With all true faith. So says my master Antony.


BRUTUS

Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;
I never thought him worse.
Tell him, so please him come unto this place,
He shall be satisfied; and, by my honour,
Depart untouch'd.


Servant

                  I'll fetch him presently.
Exit


BRUTUS

I know that we shall have him well to friend.


CASSIUS

I wish we may: but yet have I a mind
That fears him much; and my misgiving still
Falls shrewdly to the purpose.


BRUTUS

But here comes Antony.
Re-enter ANTONY
Welcome, Mark Antony.


ANTONY

O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?
Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,
Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.
I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,
Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:
If I myself, there is no hour so fit
As Caesar's death hour, nor no instrument
Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
With the most noble blood of all this world.
I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,
Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,
I shall not find myself so apt to die:
No place will please me so, no mean of death,
As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,
The choice and master spirits of this age.


BRUTUS

O Antony, beg not your death of us.
Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,
As, by our hands and this our present act,
You see we do, yet see you but our hands
And this the bleeding business they have done:
Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;
And pity to the general wrong of Rome--
As fire drives out fire, so pity pity--
Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,
To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony:
Our arms, in strength of malice, and our hearts
Of brothers' temper, do receive you in
With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.


CASSIUS

Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
In the disposing of new dignities.


BRUTUS

Only be patient till we have appeased
The multitude, beside themselves with fear,
And then we will deliver you the cause,
Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,
Have thus proceeded.


ANTONY

I doubt not of your wisdom.
Let each man render me his bloody hand:
First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;
Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;
Now, Decius Brutus, yours: now yours, Metellus;
Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;
Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius.
Gentlemen all,--alas, what shall I say?
My credit now stands on such slippery ground,
That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,
Either a coward or a flatterer.
That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true:
If then thy spirit look upon us now,
Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,
To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,
Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,
Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?
Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,
Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,
It would become me better than to close
In terms of friendship with thine enemies.
Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart;
Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,
Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy lethe.
O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;
And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.
How like a deer, strucken by many princes,
Dost thou here lie!


CASSIUS

Mark Antony,--


ANTONY

                  Pardon me, Caius Cassius:
The enemies of Caesar shall say this;
Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.


CASSIUS

I blame you not for praising Caesar so;
But what compact mean you to have with us?
Will you be prick'd in number of our friends;
Or shall we on, and not depend on you?


ANTONY

Therefore I took your hands, but was, indeed,
Sway'd from the point, by looking down on Caesar.
Friends am I with you all and love you all,
Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons
Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.


BRUTUS

Or else were this a savage spectacle:
Our reasons are so full of good regard
That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,
You should be satisfied.


ANTONY

That's all I seek:
And am moreover suitor that I may
Produce his body to the market-place;
And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,
Speak in the order of his funeral.


BRUTUS

You shall, Mark Antony.


CASSIUS

Brutus, a word with you.
Aside to BRUTUS
You know not what you do: do not consent
That Antony speak in his funeral:
Know you how much the people may be moved
By that which he will utter?


BRUTUS

By your pardon;
I will myself into the pulpit first,
And show the reason of our Caesar's death:
What Antony shall speak, I will protest
He speaks by leave and by permission,
And that we are contented Caesar shall
Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.
It shall advantage more than do us wrong.


CASSIUS

I know not what may fall; I like it not.


BRUTUS

Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.
You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,
But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,
And say you do't by our permission;
Else shall you not have any hand at all
About his funeral: and you shall speak
In the same pulpit whereto I am going,
After my speech is ended.


ANTONY

Be it so.
I do desire no more.


BRUTUS

Prepare the body then, and follow us.
Exeunt all but ANTONY


ANTONY

O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
That ever lived in the tide of times.
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,--
Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,
To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue--
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
Blood and destruction shall be so in use
And dreadful objects so familiar
That mothers shall but smile when they behold
Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;
All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:
And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,
With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
Cry  'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
With carrion men, groaning for burial.
Enter a Servant
You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?


Servant

I do, Mark Antony.


ANTONY

Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.


Servant

He did receive his letters, and is coming;
And bid me say to you by word of mouth--
O Caesar!--
Seeing the body


ANTONY

Thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep.
Passion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes,
Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,
Began to water. Is thy master coming?


Servant

He lies to-night within seven leagues of Rome.


ANTONY

Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced:
Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,
No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;
Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet, stay awhile;
Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse
Into the market-place: there shall I try
In my oration, how the people take
The cruel issue of these bloody men;
According to the which, thou shalt discourse
To young Octavius of the state of things.
Lend me your hand.
Exeunt with CAESAR's body

SCENE II. The Forum.

Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS, and a throng of Citizens


Citizens

We will be satisfied; let us be satisfied.


BRUTUS

Then follow me, and give me audience, friends.
Cassius, go you into the other street,
And part the numbers.
Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;
Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;
And public reasons shall be rendered
Of Caesar's death.


First Citizen

                  I will hear Brutus speak.


Second Citizen

I will hear Cassius; and compare their reasons,
When severally we hear them rendered.
Exit CASSIUS, with some of the Citizens. BRUTUS goes into the pulpit


Third Citizen

The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!


BRUTUS

Be patient till the last.
Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my
cause, and be silent, that you may hear: believe me
for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that
you may believe: censure me in your wisdom, and
awake your senses, that you may the better judge.
If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of
Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar
was no less than his. If then that friend demand
why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:
--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved
Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and
die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live
all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;
as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was
valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I
slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his
fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his
ambition. Who is here so base that would be a
bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.
Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If
any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so
vile that will not love his country? If any, speak;
for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.


All

None, Brutus, none.


BRUTUS

Then none have I offended. I have done no more to
Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of
his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not
extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences
enforced, for which he suffered death.
Enter ANTONY and others, with CAESAR's body
Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who,
though he had no hand in his death, shall receive
the benefit of his dying, a place in the
commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this
I depart,--that, as I slew my best lover for the
good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself,
when it shall please my country to need my death.


All

Live, Brutus! live, live!


First Citizen

Bring him with triumph home unto his house.


Second Citizen

Give him a statue with his ancestors.


Third Citizen

Let him be Caesar.


Fourth Citizen

                  Caesar's better parts
Shall be crown'd in Brutus.


First Citizen

We'll bring him to his house
With shouts and clamours.


BRUTUS

My countrymen,--


Second Citizen

Peace, silence! Brutus speaks.


First Citizen

Peace, ho!


BRUTUS

Good countrymen, let me depart alone,
And, for my sake, stay here with Antony:
Do grace to Caesar's corpse, and grace his speech
Tending to Caesar's glories; which Mark Antony,
By our permission, is allow'd to make.
I do entreat you, not a man depart,
Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
Exit


First Citizen

Stay, ho! and let us hear Mark Antony.


Third Citizen

Let him go up into the public chair;
We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.


ANTONY

For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.
Goes into the pulpit


Fourth Citizen

What does he say of Brutus?


Third Citizen

He says, for Brutus' sake,
He finds himself beholding to us all.


Fourth Citizen

'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.


First Citizen

This Caesar was a tyrant.


Third Citizen

Nay, that's certain:
We are blest that Rome is rid of him.


Second Citizen

Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.


ANTONY

You gentle Romans,--


Citizens

Peace, ho! let us hear him.


ANTONY

Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
The evil that men do lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their bones;
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--
For Brutus is an honourable man;
So are they all, all honourable men--
Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
But Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honourable man.
He hath brought many captives home to Rome
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honourable man.
You all did see that on the Lupercal
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And, sure, he is an honourable man.
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
But here I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once, not without cause:
What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?
O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
And I must pause till it come back to me.


First Citizen

Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.


Second Citizen

If thou consider rightly of the matter,
Caesar has had great wrong.


Third Citizen

Has he, masters?
I fear there will a worse come in his place.


Fourth Citizen

Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;
Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.


First Citizen

If it be found so, some will dear abide it.


Second Citizen

Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.


Third Citizen

There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.


Fourth Citizen

Now mark him, he begins again to speak.


ANTONY

But yesterday the word of Caesar might
Have stood against the world; now lies he there.
And none so poor to do him reverence.
O masters, if I were disposed to stir
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,
Who, you all know, are honourable men:
I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,
Than I will wrong such honourable men.
But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;
I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:
Let but the commons hear this testament--
Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--
And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,
Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
And, dying, mention it within their wills,
Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
Unto their issue.


Fourth Citizen

We'll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.


All

The will, the will! we will hear Caesar's will.


ANTONY

Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;
And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,
It will inflame you, it will make you mad:
'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;
For, if you should, O, what would come of it!


Fourth Citizen

Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony;
You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.


ANTONY

Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?
I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:
I fear I wrong the honourable men
Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.


Fourth Citizen

They were traitors: honourable men!


All

The will! the testament!


Second Citizen

They were villains, murderers: the will! read the will.


ANTONY

You will compel me, then, to read the will?
Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,
And let me show you him that made the will.
Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?


Several Citizens

Come down.


Second Citizen

Descend.


Third Citizen

You shall have leave.
ANTONY comes down


Fourth Citizen

A ring; stand round.


First Citizen

Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.


Second Citizen

Room for Antony, most noble Antony.


ANTONY

Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.


Several Citizens

Stand back; room; bear back.


ANTONY

If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
You all do know this mantle: I remember
The first time ever Caesar put it on;
'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,
That day he overcame the Nervii:
Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:
See what a rent the envious Casca made:
Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;
And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,
Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,
As rushing out of doors, to be resolved
If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;
For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:
Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
This was the most unkindest cut of all;
For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;
And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
Even at the base of Pompey's statua,
Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.
O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.
O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel
The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.
Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold
Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,
Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.


First Citizen

O piteous spectacle!


Second Citizen

O noble Caesar!


Third Citizen

O woful day!


Fourth Citizen

O traitors, villains!


First Citizen

O most bloody sight!


Second Citizen

We will be revenged.


All

Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay!
Let not a traitor live!


ANTONY

Stay, countrymen.


First Citizen

Peace there! hear the noble Antony.


Second Citizen

We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with him.


ANTONY

Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
They that have done this deed are honourable:
What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,
That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,
And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:
I am no orator, as Brutus is;
But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,
That love my friend; and that they know full well
That gave me public leave to speak of him:
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;
I tell you that which you yourselves do know;
Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,
And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,
And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
In every wound of Caesar that should move
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.


All

We'll mutiny.


First Citizen

We'll burn the house of Brutus.


Third Citizen

Away, then! come, seek the conspirators.


ANTONY

Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.


All

Peace, ho! Hear Antony. Most noble Antony!


ANTONY

Why, friends, you go to do you know not what:
Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?
Alas, you know not: I must tell you then:
You have forgot the will I told you of.


All

Most true. The will! Let's stay and hear the will.


ANTONY

Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
To every Roman citizen he gives,
To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.


Second Citizen

Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.


Third Citizen

O royal Caesar!


ANTONY

Hear me with patience.


All

Peace, ho!


ANTONY

Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
His private arbours and new-planted orchards,
On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,
And to your heirs for ever, common pleasures,
To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.
Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?


First Citizen

Never, never. Come, away, away!
We'll burn his body in the holy place,
And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.
Take up the body.


Second Citizen

Go fetch fire.


Third Citizen

Pluck down benches.


Fourth Citizen

Pluck down forms, windows, any thing.
Exeunt Citizens with the body


ANTONY

Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,
Take thou what course thou wilt!
Enter a Servant
How now, fellow!


Servant

Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.


ANTONY

Where is he?


Servant

He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.


ANTONY

And thither will I straight to visit him:
He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,
And in this mood will give us any thing.


Servant

I heard him say, Brutus and Cassius
Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.


ANTONY

Belike they had some notice of the people,
How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.
Exeunt

SCENE III. A street.

Enter CINNA the poet


CINNA THE POET

I dreamt to-night that I did feast with Caesar,
And things unlucky charge my fantasy:
I have no will to wander forth of doors,
Yet something leads me forth.
Enter Citizens


First Citizen

What is your name?


Second Citizen

Whither are you going?


Third Citizen

Where do you dwell?


Fourth Citizen

Are you a married man or a bachelor?


Second Citizen

Answer every man directly.


First Citizen

Ay, and briefly.


Fourth Citizen

Ay, and wisely.


Third Citizen

Ay, and truly, you were best.


CINNA THE POET

What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I
dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then, to
answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and
truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.


Second Citizen

That's as much as to say, they are fools that marry:
you'll bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed; directly.


CINNA THE POET

Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral.


First Citizen

As a friend or an enemy?


CINNA THE POET

As a friend.


Second Citizen

That matter is answered directly.


Fourth Citizen

For your dwelling,--briefly.


CINNA THE POET

Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.


Third Citizen

Your name, sir, truly.


CINNA THE POET

Truly, my name is Cinna.


First Citizen

Tear him to pieces; he's a conspirator.


CINNA THE POET

I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.


Fourth Citizen

Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad verses.


CINNA THE POET

I am not Cinna the conspirator.


Fourth Citizen

It is no matter, his name's Cinna; pluck but his
name out of his heart, and turn him going.


Third Citizen

Tear him, tear him! Come, brands ho! fire-brands:
to Brutus', to Cassius'; burn all: some to Decius'
house, and some to Casca's; some to Ligarius': away, go!
Exeunt

ACT IV
SCENE I. A house in Rome.

ANTONY, OCTAVIUS, and LEPIDUS, seated at a table


ANTONY

These many, then, shall die; their names are prick'd.


OCTAVIUS

Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?


LEPIDUS

I do consent--


OCTAVIUS

                  Prick him down, Antony.


LEPIDUS

Upon condition Publius shall not live,
Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.


ANTONY

He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.
But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house;
Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine
How to cut off some charge in legacies.


LEPIDUS

What, shall I find you here?


OCTAVIUS

Or here, or at the Capitol.
Exit LEPIDUS


ANTONY

This is a slight unmeritable man,
Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,
The three-fold world divided, he should stand
One of the three to share it?


OCTAVIUS

So you thought him;
And took his voice who should be prick'd to die,
In our black sentence and proscription.


ANTONY

Octavius, I have seen more days than you:
And though we lay these honours on this man,
To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,
He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,
To groan and sweat under the business,
Either led or driven, as we point the way;
And having brought our treasure where we will,
Then take we down his load, and turn him off,
Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,
And graze in commons.


OCTAVIUS

You may do your will;
But he's a tried and valiant soldier.


ANTONY

So is my horse, Octavius; and for that
I do appoint him store of provender:
It is a creature that I teach to fight,
To wind, to stop, to run directly on,
His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.
And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;
He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth;
A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds
On abjects, orts and imitations,
Which, out of use and staled by other men,
Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,
But as a property. And now, Octavius,
Listen great things:--Brutus and Cassius
Are levying powers: we must straight make head:
Therefore let our alliance be combined,
Our best friends made, our means stretch'd
And let us presently go sit in council,
How covert matters may be best disclosed,
And open perils surest answered.


OCTAVIUS

Let us do so: for we are at the stake,
And bay'd about with many enemies;
And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,
Millions of mischiefs.
Exeunt

SCENE II. Camp near Sardis. Before BRUTUS's tent.

Drum. Enter BRUTUS, LUCILIUS, LUCIUS, and Soldiers; TITINIUS and PINDARUS meeting them


BRUTUS

Stand, ho!


LUCILIUS

Give the word, ho! and stand.


BRUTUS

What now, Lucilius! is Cassius near?


LUCILIUS

He is at hand; and Pindarus is come
To do you salutation from his master.


BRUTUS

He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,
In his own change, or by ill officers,
Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
Things done, undone: but, if he be at hand,
I shall be satisfied.


PINDARUS

I do not doubt
But that my noble master will appear
Such as he is, full of regard and honour.


BRUTUS

He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius;
How he received you, let me be resolved.


LUCILIUS

With courtesy and with respect enough;
But not with such familiar instances,
Nor with such free and friendly conference,
As he hath used of old.


BRUTUS

Thou hast described
A hot friend cooling: ever note, Lucilius,
When love begins to sicken and decay,
It useth an enforced ceremony.
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;
But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,
Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;
But when they should endure the bloody spur,
They fall their crests, and, like deceitful jades,
Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?


LUCILIUS

They mean this night in Sardis to be quarter'd;
The greater part, the horse in general,
Are come with Cassius.


BRUTUS

Hark! he is arrived.
Low march within
March gently on to meet him.
Enter CASSIUS and his powers


CASSIUS

Stand, ho!


BRUTUS

Stand, ho! Speak the word along.


First Soldier

Stand!


Second Soldier

Stand!


Third Soldier

Stand!


CASSIUS

Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.


BRUTUS

Judge me, you gods! wrong I mine enemies?
And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?


CASSIUS

Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs;
And when you do them--


BRUTUS

Cassius, be content.
Speak your griefs softly: I do know you well.
Before the eyes of both our armies here,
Which should perceive nothing but love from us,
Let us not wrangle: bid them move away;
Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,
And I will give you audience.


CASSIUS

Pindarus,
Bid our commanders lead their charges off
A little from this ground.


BRUTUS

Lucilius, do you the like; and let no man
Come to our tent till we have done our conference.
Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.
Exeunt

SCENE III. Brutus's tent.

Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS


CASSIUS

That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:
You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella
For taking bribes here of the Sardians;
Wherein my letters, praying on his side,
Because I knew the man, were slighted off.


BRUTUS

You wronged yourself to write in such a case.


CASSIUS

In such a time as this it is not meet
That every nice offence should bear his comment.


BRUTUS

Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm;
To sell and mart your offices for gold
To undeservers.


CASSIUS

                  I an itching palm!
You know that you are Brutus that speak this,
Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.


BRUTUS

The name of Cassius honours this corruption,
And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.


CASSIUS

Chastisement!


BRUTUS

Remember March, the ides of March remember:
Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?
What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,
And not for justice? What, shall one of us
That struck the foremost man of all this world
But for supporting robbers, shall we now
Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,
And sell the mighty space of our large honours
For so much trash as may be grasped thus?
I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
Than such a Roman.


CASSIUS

                  Brutus, bay not me;
I'll not endure it: you forget yourself,
To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I,
Older in practise, abler than yourself
To make conditions.


BRUTUS

Go to; you are not, Cassius.


CASSIUS

I am.


BRUTUS

I say you are not.


CASSIUS

Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;
Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.


BRUTUS

Away, slight man!


CASSIUS

Is't possible?


BRUTUS

                  Hear me, for I will speak.
Must I give way and room to your rash choler?
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?


CASSIUS

O ye gods, ye gods! must I endure all this?


BRUTUS

All this! ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;
Go show your slaves how choleric you are,
And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch
Under your testy humour? By the gods
You shall digest the venom of your spleen,
Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,
I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,
When you are waspish.


CASSIUS

Is it come to this?


BRUTUS

You say you are a better soldier:
Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,
And it shall please me well: for mine own part,
I shall be glad to learn of noble men.


CASSIUS

You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus;
I said, an elder soldier, not a better:
Did I say 'better'?


BRUTUS

If you did, I care not.


CASSIUS

When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.


BRUTUS

Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.


CASSIUS

I durst not!


BRUTUS

No.


CASSIUS

What, durst not tempt him!


BRUTUS

For your life you durst not!


CASSIUS

Do not presume too much upon my love;
I may do that I shall be sorry for.


BRUTUS

You have done that you should be sorry for.
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,
For I am arm'd so strong in honesty
That they pass by me as the idle wind,
Which I respect not. I did send to you
For certain sums of gold, which you denied me:
For I can raise no money by vile means:
By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,
And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring
From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
By any indirection: I did send
To you for gold to pay my legions,
Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?
Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,
To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;
Dash him to pieces!


CASSIUS

I denied you not.


BRUTUS

You did.


CASSIUS

I did not: he was but a fool that brought
My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:
A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.


BRUTUS

I do not, till you practise them on me.


CASSIUS

You love me not.


BRUTUS

                  I do not like your faults.


CASSIUS

A friendly eye could never see such faults.


BRUTUS

A flatterer's would not, though they do appear
As huge as high Olympus.


CASSIUS

Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,
Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,
For Cassius is aweary of the world;
Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;
Cheque'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,
Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,
To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep
My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,
And here my naked breast; within, a heart
Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:
If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;
I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:
Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know,
When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better
Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.


BRUTUS

Sheathe your dagger:
Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;
Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour.
O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
That carries anger as the flint bears fire;
Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,
And straight is cold again.


CASSIUS

Hath Cassius lived
To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,
When grief, and blood ill-temper'd, vexeth him?


BRUTUS

When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.


CASSIUS

Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.


BRUTUS

And my heart too.


CASSIUS

                  O Brutus!


BRUTUS

What's the matter?


CASSIUS

Have not you love enough to bear with me,
When that rash humour which my mother gave me
Makes me forgetful?


BRUTUS

Yes, Cassius; and, from henceforth,
When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,
He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.


Poet

[Within]  Let me go in to see the generals;
There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet
They be alone.


LUCILIUS

[Within]  You shall not come to them.


Poet

[Within]  Nothing but death shall stay me.
Enter Poet, followed by LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, and LUCIUS


CASSIUS

How now! what's the matter?


Poet

For shame, you generals! what do you mean?
Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;
For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.


CASSIUS

Ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!


BRUTUS

Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!


CASSIUS

Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.


BRUTUS

I'll know his humour, when he knows his time:
What should the wars do with these jigging fools?
Companion, hence!


CASSIUS

                  Away, away, be gone.
Exit Poet


BRUTUS

Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders
Prepare to lodge their companies to-night.


CASSIUS

And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you
Immediately to us.
Exeunt LUCILIUS and TITINIUS


BRUTUS

Lucius, a bowl of wine!
Exit LUCIUS


CASSIUS

I did not think you could have been so angry.


BRUTUS

O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.


CASSIUS

Of your philosophy you make no use,
If you give place to accidental evils.


BRUTUS

No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.


CASSIUS

Ha! Portia!


BRUTUS

She is dead.


CASSIUS

How 'scaped I killing when I cross'd you so?
O insupportable and touching loss!
Upon what sickness?


BRUTUS

Impatient of my absence,
And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony
Have made themselves so strong:--for with her death
That tidings came;--with this she fell distract,
And, her attendants absent, swallow'd fire.


CASSIUS

And died so?


BRUTUS

                  Even so.


CASSIUS

O ye immortal gods!
Re-enter LUCIUS, with wine and taper


BRUTUS

Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.
In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.


CASSIUS

My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup;
I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.


BRUTUS

Come in, Titinius!
Exit LUCIUS
Re-enter TITINIUS, with MESSALA
Welcome, good Messala.
Now sit we close about this taper here,
And call in question our necessities.


CASSIUS

Portia, art thou gone?


BRUTUS

No more, I pray you.
Messala, I have here received letters,
That young Octavius and Mark Antony
Come down upon us with a mighty power,
Bending their expedition toward Philippi.


MESSALA

Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.


BRUTUS

With what addition?


MESSALA

That by proscription and bills of outlawry,
Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus,
Have put to death an hundred senators.


BRUTUS

Therein our letters do not well agree;
Mine speak of seventy senators that died
By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.


CASSIUS

Cicero one!


MESSALA

          Cicero is dead,
And by that order of proscription.
Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?


BRUTUS

No, Messala.


MESSALA

Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?


BRUTUS

Nothing, Messala.


MESSALA

                  That, methinks, is strange.


BRUTUS

Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?


MESSALA

No, my lord.


BRUTUS

Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.


MESSALA

Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.


BRUTUS

Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:
With meditating that she must die once,
I have the patience to endure it now.


MESSALA

Even so great men great losses should endure.


CASSIUS

I have as much of this in art as you,
But yet my nature could not bear it so.


BRUTUS

Well, to our work alive. What do you think
Of marching to Philippi presently?


CASSIUS

I do not think it good.


BRUTUS

Your reason?


CASSIUS

This it is:
'Tis better that the enemy seek us:
So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,
Doing himself offence; whilst we, lying still,
Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.


BRUTUS

Good reasons must, of force, give place to better.
The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground
Do stand but in a forced affection;
For they have grudged us contribution:
The enemy, marching along by them,
By them shall make a fuller number up,
Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;
From which advantage shall we cut him off,
If at Philippi we do face him there,
These people at our back.


CASSIUS

Hear me, good brother.


BRUTUS

Under your pardon. You must note beside,
That we have tried the utmost of our friends,
Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:
The enemy increaseth every day;
We, at the height, are ready to decline.
There is a tide in the affairs of men,
Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;
Omitted, all the voyage of their life
Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
On such a full sea are we now afloat;
And we must take the current when it serves,
Or lose our ventures.


CASSIUS

Then, with your will, go on;
We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.


BRUTUS

The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
And nature must obey necessity;
Which we will niggard with a little rest.
There is no more to say?


CASSIUS

No more. Good night:
Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.


BRUTUS

Lucius!
Enter LUCIUS
My gown.
Exit LUCIUS
Farewell, good Messala:
Good night, Titinius. Noble, noble Cassius,
Good night, and good repose.


CASSIUS

O my dear brother!
This was an ill beginning of the night:
Never come such division 'tween our souls!
Let it not, Brutus.


BRUTUS

Every thing is well.


CASSIUS

Good night, my lord.


BRUTUS

Good night, good brother.


TITINIUS

MESSALA

Good night, Lord Brutus.


BRUTUS

Farewell, every one.
Exeunt all but BRUTUS
Re-enter LUCIUS, with the gown
Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?


LUCIUS

Here in the tent.


BRUTUS

                  What, thou speak'st drowsily?
Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art o'er-watch'd.
Call Claudius and some other of my men:
I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.


LUCIUS

Varro and Claudius!
Enter VARRO and CLAUDIUS


VARRO

Calls my lord?


BRUTUS

I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;
It may be I shall raise you by and by
On business to my brother Cassius.


VARRO

So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.


BRUTUS

I will not have it so: lie down, good sirs;
It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.
Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;
I put it in the pocket of my gown.
VARRO and CLAUDIUS lie down


LUCIUS

I was sure your lordship did not give it me.


BRUTUS

Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,
And touch thy instrument a strain or two?


LUCIUS

Ay, my lord, an't please you.


BRUTUS

It does, my boy:
I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.


LUCIUS

It is my duty, sir.


BRUTUS

I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
I know young bloods look for a time of rest.


LUCIUS

I have slept, my lord, already.


BRUTUS

It was well done; and thou shalt sleep again;
I will not hold thee long: if I do live,
I will be good to thee.
Music, and a song
This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber,
Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,
That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night;
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:
If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;
I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.
Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down
Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.
Enter the Ghost of CAESAR
How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
That shapes this monstrous apparition.
It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?
Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,
That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?
Speak to me what thou art.


GHOST

Thy evil spirit, Brutus.


BRUTUS

Why comest thou?


GHOST

To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.


BRUTUS

Well; then I shall see thee again?


GHOST

Ay, at Philippi.


BRUTUS

Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.
Exit Ghost
Now I have taken heart thou vanishest:
Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.
Boy, Lucius! Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake! Claudius!


LUCIUS

The strings, my lord, are false.


BRUTUS

He thinks he still is at his instrument.
Lucius, awake!


LUCIUS

My lord?


BRUTUS

Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?


LUCIUS

My lord, I do not know that I did cry.


BRUTUS

Yes, that thou didst: didst thou see any thing?


LUCIUS

Nothing, my lord.


BRUTUS

Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudius!
To VARRO
Fellow thou, awake!


VARRO

My lord?


CLAUDIUS

My lord?


BRUTUS

Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?


VARRO

CLAUDIUS

Did we, my lord?


BRUTUS

Ay: saw you any thing?


VARRO

No, my lord, I saw nothing.


CLAUDIUS

Nor I, my lord.


BRUTUS

Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;
Bid him set on his powers betimes before,
And we will follow.


VARRO

CLAUDIUS

It shall be done, my lord.
Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. The plains of Philippi.

Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army


OCTAVIUS

Now, Antony, our hopes are answered:
You said the enemy would not come down,
But keep the hills and upper regions;
It proves not so: their battles are at hand;
They mean to warn us at Philippi here,
Answering before we do demand of them.


ANTONY

Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
Wherefore they do it: they could be content
To visit other places; and come down
With fearful bravery, thinking by this face
To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;
But 'tis not so.
Enter a Messenger


Messenger

                  Prepare you, generals:
The enemy comes on in gallant show;
Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,
And something to be done immediately.


ANTONY

Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
Upon the left hand of the even field.


OCTAVIUS

Upon the right hand I; keep thou the left.


ANTONY

Why do you cross me in this exigent?


OCTAVIUS

I do not cross you; but I will do so.
March
Drum. Enter BRUTUS, CASSIUS, and their Army; LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, MESSALA, and others


BRUTUS

They stand, and would have parley.


CASSIUS

Stand fast, Titinius: we must out and talk.


OCTAVIUS

Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?


ANTONY

No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
Make forth; the generals would have some words.


OCTAVIUS

Stir not until the signal.


BRUTUS

Words before blows: is it so, countrymen?


OCTAVIUS

Not that we love words better, as you do.


BRUTUS

Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.


ANTONY

In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words:
Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,
Crying 'Long live! hail, Caesar!'


CASSIUS

Antony,
The posture of your blows are yet unknown;
But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,
And leave them honeyless.


ANTONY

Not stingless too.


BRUTUS

O, yes, and soundless too;
For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,
And very wisely threat before you sting.


ANTONY

Villains, you did not so, when your vile daggers
Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar:
You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,
And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;
Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind
Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!


CASSIUS

Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself:
This tongue had not offended so to-day,
If Cassius might have ruled.


OCTAVIUS

Come, come, the cause: if arguing make us sweat,
The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look;
I draw a sword against conspirators;
When think you that the sword goes up again?
Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds
Be well avenged; or till another Caesar
Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.


BRUTUS

Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
Unless thou bring'st them with thee.


OCTAVIUS

So I hope;
I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.


BRUTUS

O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable.


CASSIUS

A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honour,
Join'd with a masker and a reveller!


ANTONY

Old Cassius still!


OCTAVIUS

                  Come, Antony, away!
Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth:
If you dare fight to-day, come to the field;
If not, when you have stomachs.
Exeunt OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army


CASSIUS

Why, now, blow wind, swell billow and swim bark!
The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.


BRUTUS

Ho, Lucilius! hark, a word with you.


LUCILIUS

[Standing forth]	My lord?
BRUTUS and LUCILIUS converse apart


CASSIUS

Messala!


MESSALA

[Standing forth]  What says my general?


CASSIUS

Messala,
This is my birth-day; as this very day
Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:
Be thou my witness that against my will,
As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set
Upon one battle all our liberties.
You know that I held Epicurus strong
And his opinion: now I change my mind,
And partly credit things that do presage.
Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign
Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,
Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;
Who to Philippi here consorted us:
This morning are they fled away and gone;
And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,
Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,
As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem
A canopy most fatal, under which
Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.


MESSALA

Believe not so.


CASSIUS

                  I but believe it partly;
For I am fresh of spirit and resolved
To meet all perils very constantly.


BRUTUS

Even so, Lucilius.


CASSIUS

                  Now, most noble Brutus,
The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,
Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!
But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,
Let's reason with the worst that may befall.
If we do lose this battle, then is this
The very last time we shall speak together:
What are you then determined to do?


BRUTUS

Even by the rule of that philosophy
By which I did blame Cato for the death
Which he did give himself, I know not how,
But I do find it cowardly and vile,
For fear of what might fall, so to prevent
The time of life: arming myself with patience
To stay the providence of some high powers
That govern us below.


CASSIUS

Then, if we lose this battle,
You are contented to be led in triumph
Thorough the streets of Rome?


BRUTUS

No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,
That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;
He bears too great a mind. But this same day
Must end that work the ides of March begun;
And whether we shall meet again I know not.
Therefore our everlasting farewell take:
For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!
If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;
If not, why then, this parting was well made.


CASSIUS

For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!
If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;
If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.


BRUTUS

Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know
The end of this day's business ere it come!
But it sufficeth that the day will end,
And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!
Exeunt

SCENE II. The same. The field of battle.

Alarum. Enter BRUTUS and MESSALA


BRUTUS

Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
Unto the legions on the other side.
Loud alarum
Let them set on at once; for I perceive
But cold demeanor in Octavius' wing,
And sudden push gives them the overthrow.
Ride, ride, Messala: let them all come down.
Exeunt

SCENE III. Another part of the field.

Alarums. Enter CASSIUS and TITINIUS


CASSIUS

O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!
Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy:
This ensign here of mine was turning back;
I slew the coward, and did take it from him.


TITINIUS

O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early;
Who, having some advantage on Octavius,
Took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil,
Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
Enter PINDARUS


PINDARUS

Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;
Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord
Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.


CASSIUS

This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius;
Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?


TITINIUS

They are, my lord.


CASSIUS

                  Titinius, if thou lovest me,
Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurs in him,
Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops,
And here again; that I may rest assured
Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.


TITINIUS

I will be here again, even with a thought.
Exit


CASSIUS

Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;
My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,
And tell me what thou notest about the field.
PINDARUS ascends the hill
This day I breathed first: time is come round,
And where I did begin, there shall I end;
My life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news?


PINDARUS

[Above]  O my lord!


CASSIUS

What news?


PINDARUS

[Above]  Titinius is enclosed round about
With horsemen, that make to him on the spur;
Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.
Now, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too.
He's ta'en.
Shout
And, hark! they shout for joy.


CASSIUS

Come down, behold no more.
O, coward that I am, to live so long,
To see my best friend ta'en before my face!
PINDARUS descends
Come hither, sirrah:
In Parthia did I take thee prisoner;
And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,
That whatsoever I did bid thee do,
Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;
Now be a freeman: and with this good sword,
That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom.
Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;
And, when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,
Guide thou the sword.
PINDARUS stabs him
Caesar, thou art revenged,
Even with the sword that kill'd thee.
Dies


PINDARUS

So, I am free; yet would not so have been,
Durst I have done my will. O Cassius,
Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
Where never Roman shall take note of him.
Exit
Re-enter TITINIUS with MESSALA


MESSALA

It is but change, Titinius; for Octavius
Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power,
As Cassius' legions are by Antony.


TITINIUS

These tidings will well comfort Cassius.


MESSALA

Where did you leave him?


TITINIUS

All disconsolate,
With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.


MESSALA

Is not that he t hat lies upon the ground?


TITINIUS

He lies not like the living. O my heart!


MESSALA

Is not that he?


TITINIUS

                  No, this was he, Messala,
But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,
As in thy red rays thou dost sink to-night,
So in his red blood Cassius' day is set;
The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone;
Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done!
Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.


MESSALA

Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
O hateful error, melancholy's child,
Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
The things that are not? O error, soon conceived,
Thou never comest unto a happy birth,
But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee!


TITINIUS

What, Pindarus! where art thou, Pindarus?


MESSALA

Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet
The noble Brutus, thrusting this report
Into his ears; I may say, thrusting it;
For piercing steel and darts envenomed
Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus
As tidings of this sight.


TITINIUS

Hie you, Messala,
And I will seek for Pindarus the while.
Exit MESSALA
Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?
Did I not meet thy friends? and did not they
Put on my brows this wreath of victory,
And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
Alas, thou hast misconstrued every thing!
But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;
Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I
Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,
And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
By your leave, gods:--this is a Roman's part
Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.
Kills himself
Alarum. Re-enter MESSALA, with BRUTUS, CATO, STRATO, VOLUMNIUS, and LUCILIUS


BRUTUS

Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?


MESSALA

Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.


BRUTUS

Titinius' face is upward.


CATO

He is slain.


BRUTUS

O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!
Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords
In our own proper entrails.
Low alarums


CATO

Brave Titinius!
Look, whether he have not crown'd dead Cassius!


BRUTUS

Are yet two Romans living such as these?
The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!
It is impossible that ever Rome
Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears
To this dead man than you shall see me pay.
I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.
Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body:
His funerals shall not be in our camp,
Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come;
And come, young Cato; let us to the field.
Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on:
'Tis three o'clock; and, Romans, yet ere night
We shall try fortune in a second fight.
Exeunt

SCENE IV. Another part of the field.

Alarum. Enter fighting, Soldiers of both armies; then BRUTUS, CATO, LUCILIUS, and others


BRUTUS

Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!


CATO

What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?
I will proclaim my name about the field:
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend;
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!


BRUTUS

And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;
Brutus, my country's friend; know me for Brutus!
Exit


LUCILIUS

O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius;
And mayst be honour'd, being Cato's son.


First Soldier

Yield, or thou diest.


LUCILIUS

Only I yield to die:
There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight;
Offering money
Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death.


First Soldier

We must not. A noble prisoner!


Second Soldier

Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.


First Soldier

I'll tell the news. Here comes the general.
Enter ANTONY
Brutus is ta'en, Brutus is ta'en, my lord.


ANTONY

Where is he?


LUCILIUS

Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:
I dare assure thee that no enemy
Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus:
The gods defend him from so great a shame!
When you do find him, or alive or dead,
He will be found like Brutus, like himself.


ANTONY

This is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure you,
A prize no less in worth: keep this man safe;
Give him all kindness: I had rather have
Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,
And see whether Brutus be alive or dead;
And bring us word unto Octavius' tent
How every thing is chanced.
Exeunt

SCENE V. Another part of the field.

Enter BRUTUS, DARDANIUS, CLITUS, STRATO, and VOLUMNIUS


BRUTUS

Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.


CLITUS

Statilius show'd the torch-light, but, my lord,
He came not back: he is or ta'en or slain.


BRUTUS

Sit thee down, Clitus: slaying is the word;
It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.
Whispers


CLITUS

What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.


BRUTUS

Peace then! no words.


CLITUS

I'll rather kill myself.


BRUTUS

Hark thee, Dardanius.
Whispers


DARDANIUS

Shall I do such a deed?


CLITUS

O Dardanius!


DARDANIUS

O Clitus!


CLITUS

What ill request did Brutus make to thee?


DARDANIUS

To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.


CLITUS

Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
That it runs over even at his eyes.


BRUTUS

Come hither, good Volumnius; list a word.


VOLUMNIUS

What says my lord?


BRUTUS

                  Why, this, Volumnius:
The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me
Two several times by night; at Sardis once,
And, this last night, here in Philippi fields:
I know my hour is come.


VOLUMNIUS

Not so, my lord.


BRUTUS

Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.
Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;
Our enemies have beat us to the pit:
Low alarums
It is more worthy to leap in ourselves,
Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,
Thou know'st that we two went to school together:
Even for that our love of old, I prithee,
Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.


VOLUMNIUS

That's not an office for a friend, my lord.
Alarum still


CLITUS

Fly, fly, my lord; there is no tarrying here.


BRUTUS

Farewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius.
Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;
Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,
My heart doth joy that yet in all my life
I found no man but he was true to me.
I shall have glory by this losing day
More than Octavius and Mark Antony
By this vile conquest shall attain unto.
So fare you well at once; for Brutus' tongue
Hath almost ended his life's history:
Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,
That have but labour'd to attain this hour.
Alarum. Cry within, 'Fly, fly, fly!'


CLITUS

Fly, my lord, fly.


BRUTUS

                  Hence! I will follow.
Exeunt CLITUS, DARDANIUS, and VOLUMNIUS
I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord:
Thou art a fellow of a good respect;
Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it:
Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,
While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?


STRATO

Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.


BRUTUS

Farewell, good Strato.
Runs on his sword
Caesar, now be still:
I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.
Dies
Alarum. Retreat. Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, MESSALA, LUCILIUS, and the army


OCTAVIUS

What man is that?


MESSALA

My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?


STRATO

Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:
The conquerors can but make a fire of him;
For Brutus only overcame himself,
And no man else hath honour by his death.


LUCILIUS

So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,
That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.


OCTAVIUS

All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.
Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?


STRATO

Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.


OCTAVIUS

Do so, good Messala.


MESSALA

How died my master, Strato?


STRATO

I held the sword, and he did run on it.


MESSALA

Octavius, then take him to follow thee,
That did the latest service to my master.


ANTONY

This was the noblest Roman of them all:
All the conspirators save only he
Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;
He only, in a general honest thought
And common good to all, made one of them.
His life was gentle, and the elements
So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up
And say to all the world 'This was a man!'


OCTAVIUS

According to his virtue let us use him,
With all respect and rites of burial.
Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,
Most like a soldier, order'd honourably.
So call the field to rest; and let's away,
To part the glories of this happy day.
Exeunt




King Lear

ACT I
SCENE I. King Lear's palace.

Enter KENT, GLOUCESTER, and EDMUND


KENT

I thought the king had more affected the Duke of
Albany than Cornwall.


GLOUCESTER

It did always seem so to us: but now, in the
division of the kingdom, it appears not which of
the dukes he values most; for equalities are so
weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice
of either's moiety.


KENT

Is not this your son, my lord?


GLOUCESTER

His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have
so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am
brazed to it.


KENT

I cannot conceive you.


GLOUCESTER

Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupon
she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son
for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed.
Do you smell a fault?


KENT

I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it
being so proper.


GLOUCESTER

But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year
elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account:
though this knave came something saucily into the
world before he was sent for, yet was his mother
fair; there was good sport at his making, and the
whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this
noble gentleman, Edmund?


EDMUND

No, my lord.


GLOUCESTER

My lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my
honourable friend.


EDMUND

My services to your lordship.


KENT

I must love you, and sue to know you better.


EDMUND

Sir, I shall study deserving.


GLOUCESTER

He hath been out nine years, and away he shall
again. The king is coming.
Sennet. Enter KING LEAR, CORNWALL, ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, CORDELIA, and Attendants


KING LEAR

Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.


GLOUCESTER

I shall, my liege.
Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EDMUND


KING LEAR

Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
Give me the map there. Know that we have divided
In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent
To shake all cares and business from our age;
Conferring them on younger strengths, while we
Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,
And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
We have this hour a constant will to publish
Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife
May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,
Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,
Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,
And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,--
Since now we will divest us both of rule,
Interest of territory, cares of state,--
Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
That we our largest bounty may extend
Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,
Our eldest-born, speak first.


GONERIL

Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;
Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;
Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;
No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;
As much as child e'er loved, or father found;
A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable;
Beyond all manner of so much I love you.


CORDELIA

[Aside]  What shall Cordelia do?
Love, and be silent.


LEAR

Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,
With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,
With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,
We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue
Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,
Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.


REGAN

Sir, I am made
Of the self-same metal that my sister is,
And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
I find she names my very deed of love;
Only she comes too short: that I profess
Myself an enemy to all other joys,
Which the most precious square of sense possesses;
And find I am alone felicitate
In your dear highness' love.


CORDELIA

[Aside]	Then poor Cordelia!
And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love's
More richer than my tongue.


KING LEAR

To thee and thine hereditary ever
Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;
No less in space, validity, and pleasure,
Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy,
Although the last, not least; to whose young love
The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw
A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.


CORDELIA

Nothing, my lord.


KING LEAR

Nothing!


CORDELIA

Nothing.


KING LEAR

Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.


CORDELIA

Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty
According to my bond; nor more nor less.


KING LEAR

How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,
Lest it may mar your fortunes.


CORDELIA

Good my lord,
You have begot me, bred me, loved me: I
Return those duties back as are right fit,
Obey you, love you, and most honour you.
Why have my sisters husbands, if they say
They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,
That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
Half my love with him, half my care and duty:
Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,
To love my father all.


KING LEAR

But goes thy heart with this?


CORDELIA

Ay, good my lord.


KING LEAR

So young, and so untender?


CORDELIA

So young, my lord, and true.


KING LEAR

Let it be so; thy truth, then, be thy dower:
For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,
The mysteries of Hecate, and the night;
By all the operation of the orbs
From whom we do exist, and cease to be;
Here I disclaim all my paternal care,
Propinquity and property of blood,
And as a stranger to my heart and me
Hold thee, from this, for ever. The barbarous Scythian,
Or he that makes his generation messes
To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom
Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and relieved,
As thou my sometime daughter.


KENT

Good my liege,--


KING LEAR

Peace, Kent!
Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
I loved her most, and thought to set my rest
On her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!
So be my grave my peace, as here I give
Her father's heart from her! Call France; who stirs?
Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,
With my two daughters' dowers digest this third:
Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.
I do invest you jointly with my power,
Pre-eminence, and all the large effects
That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,
With reservation of an hundred knights,
By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode
Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain
The name, and all the additions to a king;
The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,
Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,
This coronet part betwixt you.
Giving the crown


KENT

Royal Lear,
Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,
Loved as my father, as my master follow'd,
As my great patron thought on in my prayers,--


KING LEAR

The bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft.


KENT

Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly,
When Lear is mad. What wilt thou do, old man?
Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,
When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound,
When majesty stoops to folly. Reverse thy doom;
And, in thy best consideration, cheque
This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,
Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;
Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound
Reverbs no hollowness.


KING LEAR

Kent, on thy life, no more.


KENT

My life I never held but as a pawn
To wage against thy enemies; nor fear to lose it,
Thy safety being the motive.


KING LEAR

Out of my sight!


KENT

See better, Lear; and let me still remain
The true blank of thine eye.


KING LEAR

Now, by Apollo,--


KENT

                  Now, by Apollo, king,
Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.


KING LEAR

O, vassal! miscreant!
Laying his hand on his sword


ALBANY

CORNWALL

Dear sir, forbear.


KENT

Do:
Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow
Upon thy foul disease. Revoke thy doom;
Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,
I'll tell thee thou dost evil.


KING LEAR

Hear me, recreant!
On thine allegiance, hear me!
Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,
Which we durst never yet, and with strain'd pride
To come between our sentence and our power,
Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,
Our potency made good, take thy reward.
Five days we do allot thee, for provision
To shield thee from diseases of the world;
And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
Upon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following,
Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,
The moment is thy death. Away! by Jupiter,
This shall not be revoked.


KENT

Fare thee well, king: sith thus thou wilt appear,
Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.
To CORDELIA
The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,
That justly think'st, and hast most rightly said!
To REGAN and GONERIL
And your large speeches may your deeds approve,
That good effects may spring from words of love.
Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;
He'll shape his old course in a country new.
Exit
Flourish. Re-enter GLOUCESTER, with KING OF FRANCE, BURGUNDY, and Attendants


GLOUCESTER

Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.


KING LEAR

My lord of Burgundy.
We first address towards you, who with this king
Hath rivall'd for our daughter: what, in the least,
Will you require in present dower with her,
Or cease your quest of love?


BURGUNDY

Most royal majesty,
I crave no more than what your highness offer'd,
Nor will you tender less.


KING LEAR

Right noble Burgundy,
When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;
But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands:
If aught within that little seeming substance,
Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced,
And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,
She's there, and she is yours.


BURGUNDY

I know no answer.


KING LEAR

Will you, with those infirmities she owes,
Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,
Dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,
Take her, or leave her?


BURGUNDY

Pardon me, royal sir;
Election makes not up on such conditions.


KING LEAR

Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,
I tell you all her wealth.
To KING OF FRANCE
For you, great king,
I would not from your love make such a stray,
To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you
To avert your liking a more worthier way
Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed
Almost to acknowledge hers.


KING OF FRANCE

This is most strange,
That she, that even but now was your best object,
The argument of your praise, balm of your age,
Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time
Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle
So many folds of favour. Sure, her offence
Must be of such unnatural degree,
That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection
Fall'n into taint: which to believe of her,
Must be a faith that reason without miracle
Could never plant in me.


CORDELIA

I yet beseech your majesty,--
If for I want that glib and oily art,
To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,
I'll do't before I speak,--that you make known
It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,
No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,
That hath deprived me of your grace and favour;
But even for want of that for which I am richer,
A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
As I am glad I have not, though not to have it
Hath lost me in your liking.


KING LEAR

Better thou
Hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better.


KING OF FRANCE

Is it but this,--a tardiness in nature
Which often leaves the history unspoke
That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,
What say you to the lady? Love's not love
When it is mingled with regards that stand
Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?
She is herself a dowry.


BURGUNDY

Royal Lear,
Give but that portion which yourself proposed,
And here I take Cordelia by the hand,
Duchess of Burgundy.


KING LEAR

Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.


BURGUNDY

I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father
That you must lose a husband.


CORDELIA

Peace be with Burgundy!
Since that respects of fortune are his love,
I shall not be his wife.


KING OF FRANCE

Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;
Most choice, forsaken; and most loved, despised!
Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:
Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.
Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
My love should kindle to inflamed respect.
Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,
Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:
Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy
Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.
Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:
Thou losest here, a better where to find.


KING LEAR

Thou hast her, France: let her be thine; for we
Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see
That face of hers again. Therefore be gone
Without our grace, our love, our benison.
Come, noble Burgundy.
Flourish. Exeunt all but KING OF FRANCE, GONERIL, REGAN, and CORDELIA


KING OF FRANCE

Bid farewell to your sisters.


CORDELIA

The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes
Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;
And like a sister am most loath to call
Your faults as they are named. Use well our father:
To your professed bosoms I commit him
But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,
I would prefer him to a better place.
So, farewell to you both.


REGAN

Prescribe not us our duties.


GONERIL

Let your study
Be to content your lord, who hath received you
At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,
And well are worth the want that you have wanted.


CORDELIA

Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides:
Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.
Well may you prosper!


KING OF FRANCE

Come, my fair Cordelia.
Exeunt KING OF FRANCE and CORDELIA


GONERIL

Sister, it is not a little I have to say of what
most nearly appertains to us both. I think our
father will hence to-night.


REGAN

That's most certain, and with you; next month with us.


GONERIL

You see how full of changes his age is; the
observation we have made of it hath not been
little: he always loved our sister most; and
with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off
appears too grossly.


REGAN

'Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever
but slenderly known himself.


GONERIL

The best and soundest of his time hath been but
rash; then must we look to receive from his age,
not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed
condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness
that infirm and choleric years bring with them.


REGAN

Such unconstant starts are we like to have from
him as this of Kent's banishment.


GONERIL

There is further compliment of leavetaking
between France and him. Pray you, let's hit
together: if our father carry authority with
such dispositions as he bears, this last
surrender of his will but offend us.


REGAN

We shall further think on't.


GONERIL

We must do something, and i' the heat.
Exeunt

SCENE II. The Earl of Gloucester's castle.

Enter EDMUND, with a letter


EDMUND

Thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy law
My services are bound. Wherefore should I
Stand in the plague of custom, and permit
The curiosity of nations to deprive me,
For that I am some twelve or fourteen moon-shines
Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?
When my dimensions are as well compact,
My mind as generous, and my shape as true,
As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us
With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?
Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take
More composition and fierce quality
Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,
Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops,
Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well, then,
Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land:
Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund
As to the legitimate: fine word,--legitimate!
Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,
And my invention thrive, Edmund the base
Shall top the legitimate. I grow; I prosper:
Now, gods, stand up for bastards!
Enter GLOUCESTER


GLOUCESTER

Kent banish'd thus! and France in choler parted!
And the king gone to-night! subscribed his power!
Confined to exhibition! All this done
Upon the gad! Edmund, how now! what news?


EDMUND

So please your lordship, none.
Putting up the letter


GLOUCESTER

Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?


EDMUND

I know no news, my lord.


GLOUCESTER

What paper were you reading?


EDMUND

Nothing, my lord.


GLOUCESTER

No? What needed, then, that terrible dispatch of
it into your pocket? the quality of nothing hath
not such need to hide itself. Let's see: come,
if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.


EDMUND

I beseech you, sir, pardon me: it is a letter
from my brother, that I have not all o'er-read;
and for so much as I have perused, I find it not
fit for your o'er-looking.


GLOUCESTER

Give me the letter, sir.


EDMUND

I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The
contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame.


GLOUCESTER

Let's see, let's see.


EDMUND

I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote
this but as an essay or taste of my virtue.


GLOUCESTER

[Reads]  'This policy and reverence of age makes
the world bitter to the best of our times; keeps
our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish
them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage
in the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways, not
as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to
me, that of this I may speak more. If our father
would sleep till I waked him, you should half his
revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your
brother,	EDGAR.'
Hum--conspiracy!--'Sleep till I waked him,--you
should enjoy half his revenue,'--My son Edgar!
Had he a hand to write this? a heart and brain
to breed it in?--When came this to you? who
brought it?


EDMUND

It was not brought me, my lord; there's the
cunning of it; I found it thrown in at the
casement of my closet.


GLOUCESTER

You know the character to be your brother's?


EDMUND

If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear
it were his; but, in respect of that, I would
fain think it were not.


GLOUCESTER

It is his.


EDMUND

It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is
not in the contents.


GLOUCESTER

Hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business?


EDMUND

Never, my lord: but I have heard him oft
maintain it to be fit, that, sons at perfect age,
and fathers declining, the father should be as
ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.


GLOUCESTER

O villain, villain! His very opinion in the
letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested,
brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah,
seek him; I'll apprehend him: abominable villain!
Where is he?


EDMUND

I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please
you to suspend your indignation against my
brother till you can derive from him better
testimony of his intent, you shall run a certain
course; where, if you violently proceed against
him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great
gap in your own honour, and shake in pieces the
heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life
for him, that he hath wrote this to feel my
affection to your honour, and to no further
pretence of danger.


GLOUCESTER

Think you so?


EDMUND

If your honour judge it meet, I will place you
where you shall hear us confer of this, and by an
auricular assurance have your satisfaction; and
that without any further delay than this very evening.


GLOUCESTER

He cannot be such a monster--


EDMUND

Nor is not, sure.


GLOUCESTER

To his father, that so tenderly and entirely
loves him. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him
out: wind me into him, I pray you: frame the
business after your own wisdom. I would unstate
myself, to be in a due resolution.


EDMUND

I will seek him, sir, presently: convey the
business as I shall find means and acquaint you withal.


GLOUCESTER

These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend
no good to us: though the wisdom of nature can
reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself
scourged by the sequent effects: love cools,
friendship falls off, brothers divide: in
cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in
palaces, treason; and the bond cracked 'twixt son
and father. This villain of mine comes under the
prediction; there's son against father: the king
falls from bias of nature; there's father against
child. We have seen the best of our time:
machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all
ruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to our
graves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shall
lose thee nothing; do it carefully. And the
noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his
offence, honesty! 'Tis strange.
Exit


EDMUND

This is the excellent foppery of the world, that,
when we are sick in fortune,--often the surfeit
of our own behavior,--we make guilty of our
disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars: as
if we were villains by necessity; fools by
heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and
treachers, by spherical predominance; drunkards,
liars, and adulterers, by an enforced obedience of
planetary influence; and all that we are evil in,
by a divine thrusting on: an admirable evasion
of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish
disposition to the charge of a star! My
father compounded with my mother under the
dragon's tail; and my nativity was under Ursa
major; so that it follows, I am rough and
lecherous. Tut, I should have been that I am,
had the maidenliest star in the firmament
twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar--
Enter EDGAR
And pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old
comedy: my cue is villanous melancholy, with a
sigh like Tom o' Bedlam. O, these eclipses do
portend these divisions! fa, sol, la, mi.


EDGAR

How now, brother Edmund! what serious
contemplation are you in?


EDMUND

I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read
this other day, what should follow these eclipses.


EDGAR

Do you busy yourself about that?


EDMUND

I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed
unhappily; as of unnaturalness between the child
and the parent; death, dearth, dissolutions of
ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and
maledictions against king and nobles; needless
diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation
of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what.


EDGAR

How long have you been a sectary astronomical?


EDMUND

Come, come; when saw you my father last?


EDGAR

Why, the night gone by.


EDMUND

Spake you with him?


EDGAR

Ay, two hours together.


EDMUND

Parted you in good terms? Found you no
displeasure in him by word or countenance?


EDGAR

None at all.


EDMUND

Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended
him: and at my entreaty forbear his presence
till some little time hath qualified the heat of
his displeasure; which at this instant so rageth
in him, that with the mischief of your person it
would scarcely allay.


EDGAR

Some villain hath done me wrong.


EDMUND

That's my fear. I pray you, have a continent
forbearance till the spied of his rage goes
slower; and, as I say, retire with me to my
lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to
hear my lord speak: pray ye, go; there's my key:
if you do stir abroad, go armed.


EDGAR

Armed, brother!


EDMUND

Brother, I advise you to the best; go armed: I
am no honest man if there be any good meaning
towards you: I have told you what I have seen
and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image
and horror of it: pray you, away.


EDGAR

Shall I hear from you anon?


EDMUND

I do serve you in this business.
Exit EDGAR
A credulous father! and a brother noble,
Whose nature is so far from doing harms,
That he suspects none: on whose foolish honesty
My practises ride easy! I see the business.
Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit:
All with me's meet that I can fashion fit.
Exit

SCENE III. The Duke of Albany's palace.

Enter GONERIL, and OSWALD, her steward


GONERIL

Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?


OSWALD

Yes, madam.


GONERIL

By day and night he wrongs me; every hour
He flashes into one gross crime or other,
That sets us all at odds: I'll not endure it:
His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us
On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,
I will not speak with him; say I am sick:
If you come slack of former services,
You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer.


OSWALD

He's coming, madam; I hear him.
Horns within


GONERIL

Put on what weary negligence you please,
You and your fellows; I'll have it come to question:
If he dislike it, let him to our sister,
Whose mind and mine, I know, in that are one,
Not to be over-ruled. Idle old man,
That still would manage those authorities
That he hath given away! Now, by my life,
Old fools are babes again; and must be used
With cheques as flatteries,--when they are seen abused.
Remember what I tell you.


OSWALD

Well, madam.


GONERIL

And let his knights have colder looks among you;
What grows of it, no matter; advise your fellows so:
I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,
That I may speak: I'll write straight to my sister,
To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.
Exeunt

SCENE IV. A hall in the same.

Enter KENT, disguised


KENT

If but as well I other accents borrow,
That can my speech defuse, my good intent
May carry through itself to that full issue
For which I razed my likeness. Now, banish'd Kent,
If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd,
So may it come, thy master, whom thou lovest,
Shall find thee full of labours.
Horns within. Enter KING LEAR, Knights, and Attendants


KING LEAR

Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready.
Exit an Attendant
How now! what art thou?


KENT

A man, sir.


KING LEAR

What dost thou profess? what wouldst thou with us?


KENT

I do profess to be no less than I seem; to serve
him truly that will put me in trust: to love him
that is honest; to converse with him that is wise,
and says little; to fear judgment; to fight when I
cannot choose; and to eat no fish.


KING LEAR

What art thou?


KENT

A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the king.


KING LEAR

If thou be as poor for a subject as he is for a
king, thou art poor enough. What wouldst thou?


KENT

Service.


KING LEAR

Who wouldst thou serve?


KENT

You.


KING LEAR

Dost thou know me, fellow?


KENT

No, sir; but you have that in your countenance
which I would fain call master.


KING LEAR

What's that?


KENT

Authority.


KING LEAR

What services canst thou do?


KENT

I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious
tale in telling it, and deliver a plain message
bluntly: that which ordinary men are fit for, I am
qualified in; and the best of me is diligence.


KING LEAR

How old art thou?


KENT

Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor
so old to dote on her for any thing: I have years
on my back forty eight.


KING LEAR

Follow me; thou shalt serve me: if I like thee no
worse after dinner, I will not part from thee yet.
Dinner, ho, dinner! Where's my knave? my fool?
Go you, and call my fool hither.
Exit an Attendant
Enter OSWALD
You, you, sirrah, where's my daughter?


OSWALD

So please you,--
Exit


KING LEAR

What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back.
Exit a Knight
Where's my fool, ho? I think the world's asleep.
Re-enter Knight
How now! where's that mongrel?


Knight

He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.


KING LEAR

Why came not the slave back to me when I called him.


Knight

Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would
not.


KING LEAR

He would not!


Knight

My lord, I know not what the matter is; but, to my
judgment, your highness is not entertained with that
ceremonious affection as you were wont; there's a
great abatement of kindness appears as well in the
general dependants as in the duke himself also and
your daughter.


KING LEAR

Ha! sayest thou so?


Knight

I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken;
for my duty cannot be silent when I think your
highness wronged.


KING LEAR

Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception: I
have perceived a most faint neglect of late; which I
have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity
than as a very pretence and purpose of unkindness:
I will look further into't. But where's my fool? I
have not seen him this two days.


Knight

Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the
fool hath much pined away.


KING LEAR

No more of that; I have noted it well. Go you, and
tell my daughter I would speak with her.
Exit an Attendant
Go you, call hither my fool.
Exit an Attendant
Re-enter OSWALD
O, you sir, you, come you hither, sir: who am I,
sir?


OSWALD

My lady's father.


KING LEAR

'My lady's father'! my lord's knave: your
whoreson dog! you slave! you cur!


OSWALD

I am none of these, my lord; I beseech your pardon.


KING LEAR

Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?
Striking him


OSWALD

I'll not be struck, my lord.


KENT

Nor tripped neither, you base football player.
Tripping up his heels


KING LEAR

I thank thee, fellow; thou servest me, and I'll
love thee.


KENT

Come, sir, arise, away! I'll teach you differences:
away, away! if you will measure your lubber's
length again, tarry: but away! go to; have you
wisdom? so.
Pushes OSWALD out


KING LEAR

Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee: there's
earnest of thy service.
Giving KENT money
Enter Fool


Fool

Let me hire him too: here's my coxcomb.
Offering KENT his cap


KING LEAR

How now, my pretty knave! how dost thou?


Fool

Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.


KENT

Why, fool?


Fool

Why, for taking one's part that's out of favour:
nay, an thou canst not smile as the wind sits,
thou'lt catch cold shortly: there, take my coxcomb:
why, this fellow has banished two on's daughters,
and did the third a blessing against his will; if
thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.
How now, nuncle! Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!


KING LEAR

Why, my boy?


Fool

If I gave them all my living, I'ld keep my coxcombs
myself. There's mine; beg another of thy daughters.


KING LEAR

Take heed, sirrah; the whip.


Fool

Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipped
out, when Lady the brach may stand by the fire and stink.


KING LEAR

A pestilent gall to me!


Fool

Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech.


KING LEAR

Do.


Fool

Mark it, nuncle:
Have more than thou showest,
Speak less than thou knowest,
Lend less than thou owest,
Ride more than thou goest,
Learn more than thou trowest,
Set less than thou throwest;
Leave thy drink and thy whore,
And keep in-a-door,
And thou shalt have more
Than two tens to a score.


KENT

This is nothing, fool.


Fool

Then 'tis like the breath of an unfee'd lawyer; you
gave me nothing for't. Can you make no use of
nothing, nuncle?


KING LEAR

Why, no, boy; nothing can be made out of nothing.


Fool

[To KENT]  Prithee, tell him, so much the rent of
his land comes to: he will not believe a fool.


KING LEAR

A bitter fool!


Fool

Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a
bitter fool and a sweet fool?


KING LEAR

No, lad; teach me.


Fool

That lord that counsell'd thee
To give away thy land,
Come place him here by me,
Do thou for him stand:
The sweet and bitter fool
Will presently appear;
The one in motley here,
The other found out there.


KING LEAR

Dost thou call me fool, boy?


Fool

All thy other titles thou hast given away; that
thou wast born with.


KENT

This is not altogether fool, my lord.


Fool

No, faith, lords and great men will not let me; if
I had a monopoly out, they would have part on't:
and ladies too, they will not let me have all fool
to myself; they'll be snatching. Give me an egg,
nuncle, and I'll give thee two crowns.


KING LEAR

What two crowns shall they be?


Fool

Why, after I have cut the egg i' the middle, and eat
up the meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou
clovest thy crown i' the middle, and gavest away
both parts, thou borest thy ass on thy back o'er
the dirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown,
when thou gavest thy golden one away. If I speak
like myself in this, let him be whipped that first
finds it so.
Singing
Fools had ne'er less wit in a year;
For wise men are grown foppish,
They know not how their wits to wear,
Their manners are so apish.


KING LEAR

When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?


Fool

I have used it, nuncle, ever since thou madest thy
daughters thy mothers: for when thou gavest them
the rod, and put'st down thine own breeches,
Singing
Then they for sudden joy did weep,
And I for sorrow sung,
That such a king should play bo-peep,
And go the fools among.
Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach
thy fool to lie: I would fain learn to lie.


KING LEAR

An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipped.


Fool

I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are:
they'll have me whipped for speaking true, thou'lt
have me whipped for lying; and sometimes I am
whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be any
kind o' thing than a fool: and yet I would not be
thee, nuncle; thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides,
and left nothing i' the middle: here comes one o'
the parings.
Enter GONERIL


KING LEAR

How now, daughter! what makes that frontlet on?
Methinks you are too much of late i' the frown.


Fool

Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to
care for her frowning; now thou art an O without a
figure: I am better than thou art now; I am a fool,
thou art nothing.
To GONERIL
Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue; so your face
bids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum,
He that keeps nor crust nor crum,
Weary of all, shall want some.
Pointing to KING LEAR
That's a shealed peascod.


GONERIL

Not only, sir, this your all-licensed fool,
But other of your insolent retinue
Do hourly carp and quarrel; breaking forth
In rank and not-to-be endured riots. Sir,
I had thought, by making this well known unto you,
To have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful,
By what yourself too late have spoke and done.
That you protect this course, and put it on
By your allowance; which if you should, the fault
Would not 'scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,
Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,
Might in their working do you that offence,
Which else were shame, that then necessity
Will call discreet proceeding.


Fool

For, you trow, nuncle,
The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long,
That it's had it head bit off by it young.
So, out went the candle, and we were left darkling.


KING LEAR

Are you our daughter?


GONERIL

Come, sir,
I would you would make use of that good wisdom,
Whereof I know you are fraught; and put away
These dispositions, that of late transform you
From what you rightly are.


Fool

May not an ass know when the cart
draws the horse? Whoop, Jug! I love thee.


KING LEAR

Doth any here know me? This is not Lear:
Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?
Either his notion weakens, his discernings
Are lethargied--Ha! waking? 'tis not so.
Who is it that can tell me who I am?


Fool

Lear's shadow.


KING LEAR

I would learn that; for, by the
marks of sovereignty, knowledge, and reason,
I should be false persuaded I had daughters.


Fool

Which they will make an obedient father.


KING LEAR

Your name, fair gentlewoman?


GONERIL

This admiration, sir, is much o' the savour
Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you
To understand my purposes aright:
As you are old and reverend, you should be wise.
Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;
Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd and bold,
That this our court, infected with their manners,
Shows like a riotous inn: epicurism and lust
Make it more like a tavern or a brothel
Than a graced palace. The shame itself doth speak
For instant remedy: be then desired
By her, that else will take the thing she begs,
A little to disquantity your train;
And the remainder, that shall still depend,
To be such men as may besort your age,
And know themselves and you.


KING LEAR

Darkness and devils!
Saddle my horses; call my train together:
Degenerate bastard! I'll not trouble thee.
Yet have I left a daughter.


GONERIL

You strike my people; and your disorder'd rabble
Make servants of their betters.
Enter ALBANY


KING LEAR

Woe, that too late repents,--
To ALBANY
O, sir, are you come?
Is it your will? Speak, sir. Prepare my horses.
Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,
More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child
Than the sea-monster!


ALBANY

Pray, sir, be patient.


KING LEAR

[To GONERIL]  Detested kite! thou liest.
My train are men of choice and rarest parts,
That all particulars of duty know,
And in the most exact regard support
The worships of their name. O most small fault,
How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!
That, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature
From the fix'd place; drew from heart all love,
And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!
Beat at this gate, that let thy folly in,
Striking his head
And thy dear judgment out! Go, go, my people.


ALBANY

My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant
Of what hath moved you.


KING LEAR

It may be so, my lord.
Hear, nature, hear; dear goddess, hear!
Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend
To make this creature fruitful!
Into her womb convey sterility!
Dry up in her the organs of increase;
And from her derogate body never spring
A babe to honour her! If she must teem,
Create her child of spleen; that it may live,
And be a thwart disnatured torment to her!
Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth;
With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks;
Turn all her mother's pains and benefits
To laughter and contempt; that she may feel
How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is
To have a thankless child! Away, away!
Exit


ALBANY

Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?


GONERIL

Never afflict yourself to know the cause;
But let his disposition have that scope
That dotage gives it.
Re-enter KING LEAR


KING LEAR

What, fifty of my followers at a clap!
Within a fortnight!


ALBANY

What's the matter, sir?


KING LEAR

I'll tell thee:
To GONERIL
Life and death! I am ashamed
That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;
That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,
Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!
The untented woundings of a father's curse
Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,
Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out,
And cast you, with the waters that you lose,
To temper clay. Yea, it is come to this?
Let is be so: yet have I left a daughter,
Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable:
When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails
She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find
That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think
I have cast off for ever: thou shalt,
I warrant thee.
Exeunt KING LEAR, KENT, and Attendants


GONERIL

Do you mark that, my lord?


ALBANY

I cannot be so partial, Goneril,
To the great love I bear you,--


GONERIL

Pray you, content. What, Oswald, ho!
To the Fool
You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master.


Fool

Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry and take the fool
with thee.
A fox, when one has caught her,
And such a daughter,
Should sure to the slaughter,
If my cap would buy a halter:
So the fool follows after.
Exit


GONERIL

This man hath had good counsel:--a hundred knights!
'Tis politic and safe to let him keep
At point a hundred knights: yes, that, on every dream,
Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
He may enguard his dotage with their powers,
And hold our lives in mercy. Oswald, I say!


ALBANY

Well, you may fear too far.


GONERIL

Safer than trust too far:
Let me still take away the harms I fear,
Not fear still to be taken: I know his heart.
What he hath utter'd I have writ my sister
If she sustain him and his hundred knights
When I have show'd the unfitness,--
Re-enter OSWALD
How now, Oswald!
What, have you writ that letter to my sister?


OSWALD

Yes, madam.


GONERIL

Take you some company, and away to horse:
Inform her full of my particular fear;
And thereto add such reasons of your own
As may compact it more. Get you gone;
And hasten your return.
Exit OSWALD
No, no, my lord,
This milky gentleness and course of yours
Though I condemn not, yet, under pardon,
You are much more attask'd for want of wisdom
Than praised for harmful mildness.


ALBANY

How far your eyes may pierce I can not tell:
Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.


GONERIL

Nay, then--


ALBANY

Well, well; the event.
Exeunt

SCENE V. Court before the same.

Enter KING LEAR, KENT, and Fool


KING LEAR

Go you before to Gloucester with these letters.
Acquaint my daughter no further with any thing you
know than comes from her demand out of the letter.
If your diligence be not speedy, I shall be there afore you.


KENT

I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered
your letter.
Exit


Fool

If a man's brains were in's heels, were't not in
danger of kibes?


KING LEAR

Ay, boy.


Fool

Then, I prithee, be merry; thy wit shall ne'er go
slip-shod.


KING LEAR

Ha, ha, ha!


Fool

Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly;
for though she's as like this as a crab's like an
apple, yet I can tell what I can tell.


KING LEAR

Why, what canst thou tell, my boy?


Fool

She will taste as like this as a crab does to a
crab. Thou canst tell why one's nose stands i'
the middle on's face?


KING LEAR

No.


Fool

Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose; that
what a man cannot smell out, he may spy into.


KING LEAR

I did her wrong--


Fool

Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?


KING LEAR

No.


Fool

Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.


KING LEAR

Why?


Fool

Why, to put his head in; not to give it away to his
daughters, and leave his horns without a case.


KING LEAR

I will forget my nature. So kind a father! Be my
horses ready?


Fool

Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the
seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason.


KING LEAR

Because they are not eight?


Fool

Yes, indeed: thou wouldst make a good fool.


KING LEAR

To take 't again perforce! Monster ingratitude!


Fool

If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I'ld have thee beaten
for being old before thy time.


KING LEAR

How's that?


Fool

Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst
been wise.


KING LEAR

O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven
Keep me in temper: I would not be mad!
Enter Gentleman
How now! are the horses ready?


Gentleman

Ready, my lord.


KING LEAR

Come, boy.


Fool

She that's a maid now, and laughs at my departure,
Shall not be a maid long, unless things be cut shorter.
Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. GLOUCESTER's castle.

Enter EDMUND, and CURAN meets him


EDMUND

Save thee, Curan.


CURAN

And you, sir. I have been with your father, and
given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan
his duchess will be here with him this night.


EDMUND

How comes that?


CURAN

Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad;
I mean the whispered ones, for they are yet but
ear-kissing arguments?


EDMUND

Not I	pray you, what are they?


CURAN

Have you heard of no likely wars toward, 'twixt the
Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?


EDMUND

Not a word.


CURAN

You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.
Exit


EDMUND

The duke be here to-night? The better! best!
This weaves itself perforce into my business.
My father hath set guard to take my brother;
And I have one thing, of a queasy question,
Which I must act: briefness and fortune, work!
Brother, a word; descend: brother, I say!
Enter EDGAR
My father watches: O sir, fly this place;
Intelligence is given where you are hid;
You have now the good advantage of the night:
Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?
He's coming hither: now, i' the night, i' the haste,
And Regan with him: have you nothing said
Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?
Advise yourself.


EDGAR

                  I am sure on't, not a word.


EDMUND

I hear my father coming: pardon me:
In cunning I must draw my sword upon you
Draw; seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.
Yield: come before my father. Light, ho, here!
Fly, brother. Torches, torches! So, farewell.
Exit EDGAR
Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion.
Wounds his arm
Of my more fierce endeavour: I have seen drunkards
Do more than this in sport. Father, father!
Stop, stop! No help?
Enter GLOUCESTER, and Servants with torches


GLOUCESTER

Now, Edmund, where's the villain?


EDMUND

Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,
Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon
To stand auspicious mistress,--


GLOUCESTER

But where is he?


EDMUND

Look, sir, I bleed.


GLOUCESTER

Where is the villain, Edmund?


EDMUND

Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could--


GLOUCESTER

Pursue him, ho! Go after.
Exeunt some Servants
By no means what?


EDMUND

Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;
But that I told him, the revenging gods
'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;
Spoke, with how manifold and strong a bond
The child was bound to the father; sir, in fine,
Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion,
With his prepared sword, he charges home
My unprovided body, lanced mine arm:
But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,
Bold in the quarrel's right, roused to the encounter,
Or whether gasted by the noise I made,
Full suddenly he fled.


GLOUCESTER

Let him fly far:
Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;
And found--dispatch. The noble duke my master,
My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night:
By his authority I will proclaim it,
That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,
Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;
He that conceals him, death.


EDMUND

When I dissuaded him from his intent,
And found him pight to do it, with curst speech
I threaten'd to discover him: he replied,
'Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,
If I would stand against thee, would the reposal
Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee
Make thy words faith'd? No: what I should deny,--
As this I would: ay, though thou didst produce
My very character,--I'ld turn it all
To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practise:
And thou must make a dullard of the world,
If they not thought the profits of my death
Were very pregnant and potential spurs
To make thee seek it.'


GLOUCESTER

Strong and fasten'd villain
Would he deny his letter? I never got him.
Tucket within
Hark, the duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.
All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not 'scape;
The duke must grant me that: besides, his picture
I will send far and near, that all the kingdom
May have the due note of him; and of my land,
Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means
To make thee capable.
Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, and Attendants


CORNWALL

How now, my noble friend! since I came hither,
Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news.


REGAN

If it be true, all vengeance comes too short
Which can pursue the offender. How dost, my lord?


GLOUCESTER

O, madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd!


REGAN

What, did my father's godson seek your life?
He whom my father named? your Edgar?


GLOUCESTER

O, lady, lady, shame would have it hid!


REGAN

Was he not companion with the riotous knights
That tend upon my father?


GLOUCESTER

I know not, madam: 'tis too bad, too bad.


EDMUND

Yes, madam, he was of that consort.


REGAN

No marvel, then, though he were ill affected:
'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,
To have the expense and waste of his revenues.
I have this present evening from my sister
Been well inform'd of them; and with such cautions,
That if they come to sojourn at my house,
I'll not be there.


CORNWALL

Nor I, assure thee, Regan.
Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father
A child-like office.


EDMUND

'Twas my duty, sir.


GLOUCESTER

He did bewray his practise; and received
This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.


CORNWALL

Is he pursued?


GLOUCESTER

                  Ay, my good lord.


CORNWALL

If he be taken, he shall never more
Be fear'd of doing harm: make your own purpose,
How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,
Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant
So much commend itself, you shall be ours:
Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;
You we first seize on.


EDMUND

I shall serve you, sir,
Truly, however else.


GLOUCESTER

For him I thank your grace.


CORNWALL

You know not why we came to visit you,--


REGAN

Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night:
Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,
Wherein we must have use of your advice:
Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,
Of differences, which I least thought it fit
To answer from our home; the several messengers
From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,
Lay comforts to your bosom; and bestow
Your needful counsel to our business,
Which craves the instant use.


GLOUCESTER

I serve you, madam:
Your graces are right welcome.
Exeunt

SCENE II. Before Gloucester's castle.

Enter KENT and OSWALD, severally


OSWALD

Good dawning to thee, friend: art of this house?


KENT

Ay.


OSWALD

Where may we set our horses?


KENT

I' the mire.


OSWALD

Prithee, if thou lovest me, tell me.


KENT

I love thee not.


OSWALD

Why, then, I care not for thee.


KENT

If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make thee
care for me.


OSWALD

Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.


KENT

Fellow, I know thee.


OSWALD

What dost thou know me for?


KENT

A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a
base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited,
hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a
lily-livered, action-taking knave, a whoreson,
glass-gazing, super-serviceable finical rogue;
one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a
bawd, in way of good service, and art nothing but
the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar,
and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch: one whom I
will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deniest
the least syllable of thy addition.


OSWALD

Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail
on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!


KENT

What a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny thou
knowest me! Is it two days ago since I tripped up
thy heels, and beat thee before the king? Draw, you
rogue: for, though it be night, yet the moon
shines; I'll make a sop o' the moonshine of you:
draw, you whoreson cullionly barber-monger, draw.
Drawing his sword


OSWALD

Away! I have nothing to do with thee.


KENT

Draw, you rascal: you come with letters against the
king; and take vanity the puppet's part against the
royalty of her father: draw, you rogue, or I'll so
carbonado your shanks: draw, you rascal; come your ways.


OSWALD

Help, ho! murder! help!


KENT

Strike, you slave; stand, rogue, stand; you neat
slave, strike.
Beating him


OSWALD

Help, ho! murder! murder!
Enter EDMUND, with his rapier drawn, CORNWALL, REGAN, GLOUCESTER, and Servants


EDMUND

How now! What's the matter?


KENT

With you, goodman boy, an you please: come, I'll
flesh ye; come on, young master.


GLOUCESTER

Weapons! arms! What 's the matter here?


CORNWALL

Keep peace, upon your lives:
He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?


REGAN

The messengers from our sister and the king.


CORNWALL

What is your difference? speak.


OSWALD

I am scarce in breath, my lord.


KENT

No marvel, you have so bestirred your valour. You
cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee: a
tailor made thee.


CORNWALL

Thou art a strange fellow: a tailor make a man?


KENT

Ay, a tailor, sir: a stone-cutter or painter could
not have made him so ill, though he had been but two
hours at the trade.


CORNWALL

Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?


OSWALD

This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared
at suit of his gray beard,--


KENT

Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My
lord, if you will give me leave, I will tread this
unbolted villain into mortar, and daub the wall of
a jakes with him. Spare my gray beard, you wagtail?


CORNWALL

Peace, sirrah!
You beastly knave, know you no reverence?


KENT

Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege.


CORNWALL

Why art thou angry?


KENT

That such a slave as this should wear a sword,
Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,
Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain
Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion
That in the natures of their lords rebel;
Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;
Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks
With every gale and vary of their masters,
Knowing nought, like dogs, but following.
A plague upon your epileptic visage!
Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?
Goose, if I had you upon Sarum plain,
I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot.


CORNWALL

Why, art thou mad, old fellow?


GLOUCESTER

How fell you out? say that.


KENT

No contraries hold more antipathy
Than I and such a knave.


CORNWALL

Why dost thou call him a knave?  What's his offence?


KENT

His countenance likes me not.


CORNWALL

No more, perchance, does mine, nor his, nor hers.


KENT

Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain:
I have seen better faces in my time
Than stands on any shoulder that I see
Before me at this instant.


CORNWALL

This is some fellow,
Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect
A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb
Quite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,
An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth!
An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.
These kind of knaves I know, which in this plainness
Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
Than twenty silly ducking observants
That stretch their duties nicely.


KENT

Sir, in good sooth, in sincere verity,
Under the allowance of your great aspect,
Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire
On flickering Phoebus' front,--


CORNWALL

What mean'st by this?


KENT

To go out of my dialect, which you
discommend so much. I know, sir, I am no
flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain
accent was a plain knave; which for my part
I will not be, though I should win your displeasure
to entreat me to 't.


CORNWALL

What was the offence you gave him?


OSWALD

I never gave him any:
It pleased the king his master very late
To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;
When he, conjunct and flattering his displeasure,
Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd,
And put upon him such a deal of man,
That worthied him, got praises of the king
For him attempting who was self-subdued;
And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,
Drew on me here again.


KENT

None of these rogues and cowards
But Ajax is their fool.


CORNWALL

Fetch forth the stocks!
You stubborn ancient knave, you reverend braggart,
We'll teach you--


KENT

                  Sir, I am too old to learn:
Call not your stocks for me: I serve the king;
On whose employment I was sent to you:
You shall do small respect, show too bold malice
Against the grace and person of my master,
Stocking his messenger.


CORNWALL

Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,
There shall he sit till noon.


REGAN

Till noon! till night, my lord; and all night too.


KENT

Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,
You should not use me so.


REGAN

Sir, being his knave, I will.


CORNWALL

This is a fellow of the self-same colour
Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!
Stocks brought out


GLOUCESTER

Let me beseech your grace not to do so:
His fault is much, and the good king his master
Will cheque him for 't: your purposed low correction
Is such as basest and contemned'st wretches
For pilferings and most common trespasses
Are punish'd with: the king must take it ill,
That he's so slightly valued in his messenger,
Should have him thus restrain'd.


CORNWALL

I'll answer that.


REGAN

My sister may receive it much more worse,
To have her gentleman abused, assaulted,
For following her affairs. Put in his legs.
KENT is put in the stocks
Come, my good lord, away.
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER and KENT


GLOUCESTER

I am sorry for thee, friend; 'tis the duke's pleasure,
Whose disposition, all the world well knows,
Will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd: I'll entreat for thee.


KENT

Pray, do not, sir: I have watched and travell'd hard;
Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.
A good man's fortune may grow out at heels:
Give you good morrow!


GLOUCESTER

The duke's to blame in this; 'twill be ill taken.
Exit


KENT

Good king, that must approve the common saw,
Thou out of heaven's benediction comest
To the warm sun!
Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,
That by thy comfortable beams I may
Peruse this letter! Nothing almost sees miracles
But misery: I know 'tis from Cordelia,
Who hath most fortunately been inform'd
Of my obscured course; and shall find time
From this enormous state, seeking to give
Losses their remedies. All weary and o'erwatch'd,
Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold
This shameful lodging.
Fortune, good night: smile once more: turn thy wheel!
Sleeps

SCENE III. A wood.

Enter EDGAR


EDGAR

I heard myself proclaim'd;
And by the happy hollow of a tree
Escaped the hunt. No port is free; no place,
That guard, and most unusual vigilance,
Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may 'scape,
I will preserve myself: and am bethought
To take the basest and most poorest shape
That ever penury, in contempt of man,
Brought near to beast: my face I'll grime with filth;
Blanket my loins: elf all my hair in knots;
And with presented nakedness out-face
The winds and persecutions of the sky.
The country gives me proof and precedent
Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,
Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms
Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;
And with this horrible object, from low farms,
Poor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,
Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,
Enforce their charity. Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!
That's something yet: Edgar I nothing am.
Exit

SCENE IV. Before GLOUCESTER's castle. KENT in the stocks.

Enter KING LEAR, Fool, and Gentleman


KING LEAR

'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,
And not send back my messenger.


Gentleman

As I learn'd,
The night before there was no purpose in them
Of this remove.


KENT

                  Hail to thee, noble master!


KING LEAR

Ha!
Makest thou this shame thy pastime?


KENT

No, my lord.


Fool

Ha, ha! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied
by the heads, dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by
the loins, and men by the legs: when a man's
over-lusty at legs, then he wears wooden
nether-stocks.


KING LEAR

What's he that hath so much thy place mistook
To set thee here?


KENT

                  It is both he and she;
Your son and daughter.


KING LEAR

No.


KENT

Yes.


KING LEAR

No, I say.


KENT

I say, yea.


KING LEAR

No, no, they would not.


KENT

Yes, they have.


KING LEAR

By Jupiter, I swear, no.


KENT

By Juno, I swear, ay.


KING LEAR

They durst not do 't;
They could not, would not do 't; 'tis worse than murder,
To do upon respect such violent outrage:
Resolve me, with all modest haste, which way
Thou mightst deserve, or they impose, this usage,
Coming from us.


KENT

                  My lord, when at their home
I did commend your highness' letters to them,
Ere I was risen from the place that show'd
My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,
Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth
From Goneril his mistress salutations;
Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,
Which presently they read: on whose contents,
They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse;
Commanded me to follow, and attend
The leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:
And meeting here the other messenger,
Whose welcome, I perceived, had poison'd mine,--
Being the very fellow that of late
Display'd so saucily against your highness,--
Having more man than wit about me, drew:
He raised the house with loud and coward cries.
Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
The shame which here it suffers.


Fool

Winter's not gone yet, if the wild-geese fly that way.
Fathers that wear rags
Do make their children blind;
But fathers that bear bags
Shall see their children kind.
Fortune, that arrant whore,
Ne'er turns the key to the poor.
But, for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours
for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year.


KING LEAR

O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!
Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow,
Thy element's below! Where is this daughter?


KENT

With the earl, sir, here within.


KING LEAR

Follow me not;
Stay here.
Exit


Gentleman

Made you no more offence but what you speak of?


KENT

None.
How chance the king comes with so small a train?


Fool

And thou hadst been set i' the stocks for that
question, thou hadst well deserved it.


KENT

Why, fool?


Fool

We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee
there's no labouring i' the winter. All that follow
their noses are led by their eyes but blind men; and
there's not a nose among twenty but can smell him
that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheel
runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with
following it: but the great one that goes up the
hill, let him draw thee after. When a wise man
gives thee better counsel, give me mine again: I
would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.
That sir which serves and seeks for gain,
And follows but for form,
Will pack when it begins to rain,
And leave thee in the storm,
But I will tarry; the fool will stay,
And let the wise man fly:
The knave turns fool that runs away;
The fool no knave, perdy.


KENT

Where learned you this, fool?


Fool

Not i' the stocks, fool.
Re-enter KING LEAR with GLOUCESTER


KING LEAR

Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?
They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches;
The images of revolt and flying off.
Fetch me a better answer.


GLOUCESTER

My dear lord,
You know the fiery quality of the duke;
How unremoveable and fix'd he is
In his own course.


KING LEAR

Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!
Fiery? what quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,
I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.


GLOUCESTER

Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.


KING LEAR

Inform'd them! Dost thou understand me, man?


GLOUCESTER

Ay, my good lord.


KING LEAR

The king would speak with Cornwall; the dear father
Would with his daughter speak, commands her service:
Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!
Fiery? the fiery duke? Tell the hot duke that--
No, but not yet: may be he is not well:
Infirmity doth still neglect all office
Whereto our health is bound; we are not ourselves
When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind
To suffer with the body: I'll forbear;
And am fall'n out with my more headier will,
To take the indisposed and sickly fit
For the sound man. Death on my state! wherefore
Looking on KENT
Should he sit here? This act persuades me
That this remotion of the duke and her
Is practise only. Give me my servant forth.
Go tell the duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them,
Now, presently: bid them come forth and hear me,
Or at their chamber-door I'll beat the drum
Till it cry sleep to death.


GLOUCESTER

I would have all well betwixt you.
Exit


KING LEAR

O me, my heart, my rising heart! but, down!


Fool

Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels
when she put 'em i' the paste alive; she knapped 'em
o' the coxcombs with a stick, and cried 'Down,
wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother that, in pure
kindness to his horse, buttered his hay.
Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, GLOUCESTER, and Servants


KING LEAR

Good morrow to you both.


CORNWALL

Hail to your grace!
KENT is set at liberty


REGAN

I am glad to see your highness.


KING LEAR

Regan, I think you are; I know what reason
I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,
I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,
Sepulchring an adultress.
To KENT
O, are you free?
Some other time for that. Beloved Regan,
Thy sister's naught: O Regan, she hath tied
Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here:
Points to his heart
I can scarce speak to thee; thou'lt not believe
With how depraved a quality--O Regan!


REGAN

I pray you, sir, take patience: I have hope.
You less know how to value her desert
Than she to scant her duty.


KING LEAR

Say, how is that?


REGAN

I cannot think my sister in the least
Would fail her obligation: if, sir, perchance
She have restrain'd the riots of your followers,
'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,
As clears her from all blame.


KING LEAR

My curses on her!


REGAN

                  O, sir, you are old.
Nature in you stands on the very verge
Of her confine: you should be ruled and led
By some discretion, that discerns your state
Better than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you,
That to our sister you do make return;
Say you have wrong'd her, sir.


KING LEAR

Ask her forgiveness?
Do you but mark how this becomes the house:
'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;
Kneeling
Age is unnecessary: on my knees I beg
That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'


REGAN

Good sir, no more; these are unsightly tricks:
Return you to my sister.


KING LEAR

[Rising]  Never, Regan:
She hath abated me of half my train;
Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,
Most serpent-like, upon the very heart:
All the stored vengeances of heaven fall
On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,
You taking airs, with lameness!


CORNWALL

Fie, sir, fie!


KING LEAR

You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames
Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,
You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the powerful sun,
To fall and blast her pride!


REGAN

O the blest gods! so will you wish on me,
When the rash mood is on.


KING LEAR

No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:
Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give
Thee o'er to harshness: her eyes are fierce; but thine
Do comfort and not burn. 'Tis not in thee
To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,
To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,
And in conclusion to oppose the bolt
Against my coming in: thou better know'st
The offices of nature, bond of childhood,
Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude;
Thy half o' the kingdom hast thou not forgot,
Wherein I thee endow'd.


REGAN

Good sir, to the purpose.


KING LEAR

Who put my man i' the stocks?
Tucket within


CORNWALL

What trumpet's that?


REGAN

I know't, my sister's: this approves her letter,
That she would soon be here.
Enter OSWALD
Is your lady come?


KING LEAR

This is a slave, whose easy-borrow'd pride
Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.
Out, varlet, from my sight!


CORNWALL

What means your grace?


KING LEAR

Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope
Thou didst not know on't. Who comes here? O heavens,
Enter GONERIL
If you do love old men, if your sweet sway
Allow obedience, if yourselves are old,
Make it your cause; send down, and take my part!
To GONERIL
Art not ashamed to look upon this beard?
O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?


GONERIL

Why not by the hand, sir? How have I offended?
All's not offence that indiscretion finds
And dotage terms so.


KING LEAR

O sides, you are too tough;
Will you yet hold? How came my man i' the stocks?


CORNWALL

I set him there, sir: but his own disorders
Deserved much less advancement.


KING LEAR

You! did you?


REGAN

I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.
If, till the expiration of your month,
You will return and sojourn with my sister,
Dismissing half your train, come then to me:
I am now from home, and out of that provision
Which shall be needful for your entertainment.


KING LEAR

Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?
No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose
To wage against the enmity o' the air;
To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,--
Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?
Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took
Our youngest born, I could as well be brought
To knee his throne, and, squire-like; pension beg
To keep base life afoot. Return with her?
Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
To this detested groom.
Pointing at OSWALD


GONERIL

At your choice, sir.


KING LEAR

I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad:
I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell:
We'll no more meet, no more see one another:
But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;
Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,
Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,
A plague-sore, an embossed carbuncle,
In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee;
Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:
I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,
Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove:
Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:
I can be patient; I can stay with Regan,
I and my hundred knights.


REGAN

Not altogether so:
I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided
For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;
For those that mingle reason with your passion
Must be content to think you old, and so--
But she knows what she does.


KING LEAR

Is this well spoken?


REGAN

I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?
Is it not well? What should you need of more?
Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger
Speak 'gainst so great a number? How, in one house,
Should many people, under two commands,
Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible.


GONERIL

Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance
From those that she calls servants or from mine?


REGAN

Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack you,
We could control them. If you will come to me,--
For now I spy a danger,--I entreat you
To bring but five and twenty: to no more
Will I give place or notice.


KING LEAR

I gave you all--


REGAN

                  And in good time you gave it.


KING LEAR

Made you my guardians, my depositaries;
But kept a reservation to be follow'd
With such a number. What, must I come to you
With five and twenty, Regan? said you so?


REGAN

And speak't again, my lord; no more with me.


KING LEAR

Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd,
When others are more wicked: not being the worst
Stands in some rank of praise.
To GONERIL
I'll go with thee:
Thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty,
And thou art twice her love.


GONERIL

Hear me, my lord;
What need you five and twenty, ten, or five,
To follow in a house where twice so many
Have a command to tend you?


REGAN

What need one?


KING LEAR

O, reason not the need: our basest beggars
Are in the poorest thing superfluous:
Allow not nature more than nature needs,
Man's life's as cheap as beast's: thou art a lady;
If only to go warm were gorgeous,
Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,
Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,--
You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!
You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,
As full of grief as age; wretched in both!
If it be you that stir these daughters' hearts
Against their father, fool me not so much
To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,
And let not women's weapons, water-drops,
Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,
I will have such revenges on you both,
That all the world shall--I will do such things,--
What they are, yet I know not: but they shall be
The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep
No, I'll not weep:
I have full cause of weeping; but this heart
Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws,
Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!
Exeunt KING LEAR, GLOUCESTER, KENT, and Fool
Storm and tempest


CORNWALL

Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.


REGAN

This house is little: the old man and his people
Cannot be well bestow'd.


GONERIL

'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest,
And must needs taste his folly.


REGAN

For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,
But not one follower.


GONERIL

So am I purposed.
Where is my lord of Gloucester?


CORNWALL

Follow'd the old man forth: he is return'd.
Re-enter GLOUCESTER


GLOUCESTER

The king is in high rage.


CORNWALL

Whither is he going?


GLOUCESTER

He calls to horse; but will I know not whither.


CORNWALL

'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.


GONERIL

My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.


GLOUCESTER

Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds
Do sorely ruffle; for many miles a bout
There's scarce a bush.


REGAN

O, sir, to wilful men,
The injuries that they themselves procure
Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors:
He is attended with a desperate train;
And what they may incense him to, being apt
To have his ear abused, wisdom bids fear.


CORNWALL

Shut up your doors, my lord; 'tis a wild night:
My Regan counsels well; come out o' the storm.
Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. A heath.

Storm still. Enter KENT and a Gentleman, meeting


KENT

Who's there, besides foul weather?


Gentleman

One minded like the weather, most unquietly.


KENT

I know you. Where's the king?


Gentleman

Contending with the fretful element:
Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea,
Or swell the curled water 'bove the main,
That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,
Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,
Catch in their fury, and make nothing of;
Strives in his little world of man to out-scorn
The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.
This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,
The lion and the belly-pinched wolf
Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,
And bids what will take all.


KENT

But who is with him?


Gentleman

None but the fool; who labours to out-jest
His heart-struck injuries.


KENT

Sir, I do know you;
And dare, upon the warrant of my note,
Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,
Although as yet the face of it be cover'd
With mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;
Who have--as who have not, that their great stars
Throned and set high?--servants, who seem no less,
Which are to France the spies and speculations
Intelligent of our state; what hath been seen,
Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,
Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
Against the old kind king; or something deeper,
Whereof perchance these are but furnishings;
But, true it is, from France there comes a power
Into this scatter'd kingdom; who already,
Wise in our negligence, have secret feet
In some of our best ports, and are at point
To show their open banner. Now to you:
If on my credit you dare build so far
To make your speed to Dover, you shall find
Some that will thank you, making just report
Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
The king hath cause to plain.
I am a gentleman of blood and breeding;
And, from some knowledge and assurance, offer
This office to you.


Gentleman

I will talk further with you.


KENT

No, do not.
For confirmation that I am much more
Than my out-wall, open this purse, and take
What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia,--
As fear not but you shall,--show her this ring;
And she will tell you who your fellow is
That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!
I will go seek the king.


Gentleman

Give me your hand: have you no more to say?


KENT

Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet;
That, when we have found the king,--in which your pain
That way, I'll this,--he that first lights on him
Holla the other.
Exeunt severally

SCENE II. Another part of the heath. Storm still.

Enter KING LEAR and Fool


KING LEAR

Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!
You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout
Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!
You sulphurous and thought-executing fires,
Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,
Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,
Smite flat the thick rotundity o' the world!
Crack nature's moulds, an germens spill at once,
That make ingrateful man!


Fool

O nuncle, court holy-water in a dry
house is better than this rain-water out o' door.
Good nuncle, in, and ask thy daughters' blessing:
here's a night pities neither wise man nor fool.


KING LEAR

Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!
Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire, are my daughters:
I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness;
I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children,
You owe me no subscription: then let fall
Your horrible pleasure: here I stand, your slave,
A poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man:
But yet I call you servile ministers,
That have with two pernicious daughters join'd
Your high engender'd battles 'gainst a head
So old and white as this. O! O! 'tis foul!


Fool

He that has a house to put's head in has a good
head-piece.
The cod-piece that will house
Before the head has any,
The head and he shall louse;
So beggars marry many.
The man that makes his toe
What he his heart should make
Shall of a corn cry woe,
And turn his sleep to wake.
For there was never yet fair woman but she made
mouths in a glass.


KING LEAR

No, I will be the pattern of all patience;
I will say nothing.
Enter KENT


KENT

Who's there?


Fool

Marry, here's grace and a cod-piece; that's a wise
man and a fool.


KENT

Alas, sir, are you here? things that love night
Love not such nights as these; the wrathful skies
Gallow the very wanderers of the dark,
And make them keep their caves: since I was man,
Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,
Such groans of roaring wind and rain, I never
Remember to have heard: man's nature cannot carry
The affliction nor the fear.


KING LEAR

Let the great gods,
That keep this dreadful pother o'er our heads,
Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,
That hast within thee undivulged crimes,
Unwhipp'd of justice: hide thee, thou bloody hand;
Thou perjured, and thou simular man of virtue
That art incestuous: caitiff, to pieces shake,
That under covert and convenient seeming
Hast practised on man's life: close pent-up guilts,
Rive your concealing continents, and cry
These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man
More sinn'd against than sinning.


KENT

Alack, bare-headed!
Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel;
Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest:
Repose you there; while I to this hard house--
More harder than the stones whereof 'tis raised;
Which even but now, demanding after you,
Denied me to come in--return, and force
Their scanted courtesy.


KING LEAR

My wits begin to turn.
Come on, my boy: how dost, my boy? art cold?
I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow?
The art of our necessities is strange,
That can make vile things precious. Come,
your hovel.
Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart
That's sorry yet for thee.


Fool

[Singing]
He that has and a little tiny wit--
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,--
Must make content with his fortunes fit,
For the rain it raineth every day.


KING LEAR

True, my good boy. Come, bring us to this hovel.
Exeunt KING LEAR and KENT


Fool

This is a brave night to cool a courtezan.
I'll speak a prophecy ere I go:
When priests are more in word than matter;
When brewers mar their malt with water;
When nobles are their tailors' tutors;
No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;
When every case in law is right;
No squire in debt, nor no poor knight;
When slanders do not live in tongues;
Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;
When usurers tell their gold i' the field;
And bawds and whores do churches build;
Then shall the realm of Albion
Come to great confusion:
Then comes the time, who lives to see't,
That going shall be used with feet.
This prophecy Merlin shall make; for I live before his time.
Exit

SCENE III. Gloucester's castle.

Enter GLOUCESTER and EDMUND


GLOUCESTER

Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural
dealing. When I desire their leave that I might
pity him, they took from me the use of mine own
house; charged me, on pain of their perpetual
displeasure, neither to speak of him, entreat for
him, nor any way sustain him.


EDMUND

Most savage and unnatural!


GLOUCESTER

Go to; say you nothing. There's a division betwixt
the dukes; and a worse matter than that: I have
received a letter this night; 'tis dangerous to be
spoken; I have locked the letter in my closet:
these injuries the king now bears will be revenged
home; there's part of a power already footed: we
must incline to the king. I will seek him, and
privily relieve him: go you and maintain talk with
the duke, that my charity be not of him perceived:
if he ask for me. I am ill, and gone to bed.
Though I die for it, as no less is threatened me,
the king my old master must be relieved. There is
some strange thing toward, Edmund; pray you, be careful.
Exit


EDMUND

This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the duke
Instantly know; and of that letter too:
This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me
That which my father loses; no less than all:
The younger rises when the old doth fall.
Exit

SCENE IV. The heath. Before a hovel.

Enter KING LEAR, KENT, and Fool


KENT

Here is the place, my lord; good my lord, enter:
The tyranny of the open night's too rough
For nature to endure.
Storm still


KING LEAR

Let me alone.


KENT

Good my lord, enter here.


KING LEAR

Wilt break my heart?


KENT

I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter.


KING LEAR

Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm
Invades us to the skin: so 'tis to thee;
But where the greater malady is fix'd,
The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'ldst shun a bear;
But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,
Thou'ldst meet the bear i' the mouth. When the
mind's free,
The body's delicate: the tempest in my mind
Doth from my senses take all feeling else
Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!
Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand
For lifting food to't? But I will punish home:
No, I will weep no more. In such a night
To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.
In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!
Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all,--
O, that way madness lies; let me shun that;
No more of that.


KENT

                  Good my lord, enter here.


KING LEAR

Prithee, go in thyself: seek thine own ease:
This tempest will not give me leave to ponder
On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.
To the Fool
In, boy; go first. You houseless poverty,--
Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.
Fool goes in
Poor naked wretches, whereso'er you are,
That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,
How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,
Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you
From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en
Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp;
Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
That thou mayst shake the superflux to them,
And show the heavens more just.


EDGAR

[Within]  Fathom and half, fathom and half! Poor Tom!
The Fool runs out from the hovel


Fool

Come not in here, nuncle, here's a spirit
Help me, help me!


KENT

Give me thy hand. Who's there?


Fool

A spirit, a spirit: he says his name's poor Tom.


KENT

What art thou that dost grumble there i' the straw?
Come forth.
Enter EDGAR disguised as a mad man


EDGAR

Away! the foul fiend follows me!
Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind.
Hum! go to thy cold bed, and warm thee.


KING LEAR

Hast thou given all to thy two daughters?
And art thou come to this?


EDGAR

Who gives any thing to poor Tom? whom the foul
fiend hath led through fire and through flame, and
through ford and whirlipool e'er bog and quagmire;
that hath laid knives under his pillow, and halters
in his pew; set ratsbane by his porridge; made film
proud of heart, to ride on a bay trotting-horse over
four-inched bridges, to course his own shadow for a
traitor. Bless thy five wits! Tom's a-cold,--O, do
de, do de, do de. Bless thee from whirlwinds,
star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some
charity, whom the foul fiend vexes: there could I
have him now,--and there,--and there again, and there.
Storm still


KING LEAR

What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?
Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give them all?


Fool

Nay, he reserved a blanket, else we had been all shamed.


KING LEAR

Now, all the plagues that in the pendulous air
Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!


KENT

He hath no daughters, sir.


KING LEAR

Death, traitor! nothing could have subdued nature
To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.
Is it the fashion, that discarded fathers
Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
Judicious punishment! 'twas this flesh begot
Those pelican daughters.


EDGAR

Pillicock sat on Pillicock-hill:
Halloo, halloo, loo, loo!


Fool

This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.


EDGAR

Take heed o' the foul fiend: obey thy parents;
keep thy word justly; swear not; commit not with
man's sworn spouse; set not thy sweet heart on proud
array. Tom's a-cold.


KING LEAR

What hast thou been?


EDGAR

A serving-man, proud in heart and mind; that curled
my hair; wore gloves in my cap; served the lust of
my mistress' heart, and did the act of darkness with
her; swore as many oaths as I spake words, and
broke them in the sweet face of heaven: one that
slept in the contriving of lust, and waked to do it:
wine loved I deeply, dice dearly: and in woman
out-paramoured the Turk: false of heart, light of
ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in stealth,
wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey.
Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of
silks betray thy poor heart to woman: keep thy foot
out of brothels, thy hand out of plackets, thy pen
from lenders' books, and defy the foul fiend.
Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind:
Says suum, mun, ha, no, nonny.
Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa! let him trot by.
Storm still


KING LEAR

Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer
with thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies.
Is man no more than this? Consider him well. Thou
owest the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep
no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! here's three on
's are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself:
unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor bare,
forked animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings!
come unbutton here.
Tearing off his clothes


Fool

Prithee, nuncle, be contented; 'tis a naughty night
to swim in. Now a little fire in a wild field were
like an old lecher's heart; a small spark, all the
rest on's body cold. Look, here comes a walking fire.
Enter GLOUCESTER, with a torch


EDGAR

This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet: he begins
at curfew, and walks till the first cock; he gives
the web and the pin, squints the eye, and makes the
hare-lip; mildews the white wheat, and hurts the
poor creature of earth.
S. Withold footed thrice the old;
He met the night-mare, and her nine-fold;
Bid her alight,
And her troth plight,
And, aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!


KENT

How fares your grace?


KING LEAR

What's he?


KENT

Who's there? What is't you seek?


GLOUCESTER

What are you there? Your names?


EDGAR

Poor Tom; that eats the swimming frog, the toad,
the tadpole, the wall-newt and the water; that in
the fury of his heart, when the foul fiend rages,
eats cow-dung for sallets; swallows the old rat and
the ditch-dog; drinks the green mantle of the
standing pool; who is whipped from tithing to
tithing, and stock- punished, and imprisoned; who
hath had three suits to his back, six shirts to his
body, horse to ride, and weapon to wear;
But mice and rats, and such small deer,
Have been Tom's food for seven long year.
Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin; peace, thou fiend!


GLOUCESTER

What, hath your grace no better company?


EDGAR

The prince of darkness is a gentleman:
Modo he's call'd, and Mahu.


GLOUCESTER

Our flesh and blood is grown so vile, my lord,
That it doth hate what gets it.


EDGAR

Poor Tom's a-cold.


GLOUCESTER

Go in with me: my duty cannot suffer
To obey in all your daughters' hard commands:
Though their injunction be to bar my doors,
And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,
Yet have I ventured to come seek you out,
And bring you where both fire and food is ready.


KING LEAR

First let me talk with this philosopher.
What is the cause of thunder?


KENT

Good my lord, take his offer; go into the house.


KING LEAR

I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.
What is your study?


EDGAR

How to prevent the fiend, and to kill vermin.


KING LEAR

Let me ask you one word in private.


KENT

Importune him once more to go, my lord;
His wits begin to unsettle.


GLOUCESTER

Canst thou blame him?
Storm still
His daughters seek his death: ah, that good Kent!
He said it would be thus, poor banish'd man!
Thou say'st the king grows mad; I'll tell thee, friend,
I am almost mad myself: I had a son,
Now outlaw'd from my blood; he sought my life,
But lately, very late: I loved him, friend;
No father his son dearer: truth to tell thee,
The grief hath crazed my wits. What a night's this!
I do beseech your grace,--


KING LEAR

O, cry your mercy, sir.
Noble philosopher, your company.


EDGAR

Tom's a-cold.


GLOUCESTER

In, fellow, there, into the hovel: keep thee warm.


KING LEAR

Come let's in all.


KENT

                  This way, my lord.


KING LEAR

With him;
I will keep still with my philosopher.


KENT

Good my lord, soothe him; let him take the fellow.


GLOUCESTER

Take him you on.


KENT

Sirrah, come on; go along with us.


KING LEAR

Come, good Athenian.


GLOUCESTER

No words, no words: hush.


EDGAR

      Child Rowland to the dark tower came,
His word was still,--Fie, foh, and fum,
I smell the blood of a British man.
Exeunt

SCENE V. Gloucester's castle.

Enter CORNWALL and EDMUND


CORNWALL

I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.


EDMUND

How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus
gives way to loyalty, something fears me to think
of.


CORNWALL

I now perceive, it was not altogether your
brother's evil disposition made him seek his death;
but a provoking merit, set a-work by a reprovable
badness in himself.


EDMUND

How malicious is my fortune, that I must repent to
be just! This is the letter he spoke of, which
approves him an intelligent party to the advantages
of France: O heavens! that this treason were not,
or not I the detector!


CORNWALL

o with me to the duchess.


EDMUND

If the matter of this paper be certain, you have
mighty business in hand.


CORNWALL

True or false, it hath made thee earl of
Gloucester. Seek out where thy father is, that he
may be ready for our apprehension.


EDMUND

[Aside]  If I find him comforting the king, it will
stuff his suspicion more fully.--I will persevere in
my course of loyalty, though the conflict be sore
between that and my blood.


CORNWALL

I will lay trust upon thee; and thou shalt find a
dearer father in my love.
Exeunt

SCENE VI. A chamber in a farmhouse adjoining the castle.

Enter GLOUCESTER, KING LEAR, KENT, Fool, and EDGAR


GLOUCESTER

Here is better than the open air; take it
thankfully. I will piece out the comfort with what
addition I can: I will not be long from you.


KENT

All the power of his wits have given way to his
impatience: the gods reward your kindness!
Exit GLOUCESTER


EDGAR

Frateretto calls me; and tells me
Nero is an angler in the lake of darkness.
Pray, innocent, and beware the foul fiend.


Fool

Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a
gentleman or a yeoman?


KING LEAR

A king, a king!


Fool

No, he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son;
for he's a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman
before him.


KING LEAR

To have a thousand with red burning spits
Come hissing in upon 'em,--


EDGAR

The foul fiend bites my back.


Fool

He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a
horse's health, a boy's love, or a whore's oath.


KING LEAR

It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.
To EDGAR
Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer;
To the Fool
Thou, sapient sir, sit here. Now, you she foxes!


EDGAR

   Look, where he stands and glares!
Wantest thou eyes at trial, madam?
Come o'er the bourn, Bessy, to me,--


Fool

   Her boat hath a leak,
And she must not speak
Why she dares not come over to thee.


EDGAR

The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a
nightingale. Hopdance cries in Tom's belly for two
white herring. Croak not, black angel; I have no
food for thee.


KENT

How do you, sir? Stand you not so amazed:
Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?


KING LEAR

I'll see their trial first. Bring in the evidence.
To EDGAR
Thou robed man of justice, take thy place;
To the Fool
And thou, his yoke-fellow of equity,
Bench by his side:
To KENT
you are o' the commission,
Sit you too.


EDGAR

Let us deal justly.
Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?
Thy sheep be in the corn;
And for one blast of thy minikin mouth,
Thy sheep shall take no harm.
Pur! the cat is gray.


KING LEAR

Arraign her first; 'tis Goneril. I here take my
oath before this honourable assembly, she kicked the
poor king her father.


Fool

Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?


KING LEAR

She cannot deny it.


Fool

Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint-stool.


KING LEAR

And here's another, whose warp'd looks proclaim
What store her heart is made on. Stop her there!
Arms, arms, sword, fire! Corruption in the place!
False justicer, why hast thou let her 'scape?


EDGAR

Bless thy five wits!


KENT

O pity! Sir, where is the patience now,
That thou so oft have boasted to retain?


EDGAR

[Aside]  My tears begin to take his part so much,
They'll mar my counterfeiting.


KING LEAR

The little dogs and all, Tray, Blanch, and
Sweet-heart, see, they bark at me.


EDGAR

Tom will throw his head at them. Avaunt, you curs!
Be thy mouth or black or white,
Tooth that poisons if it bite;
Mastiff, grey-hound, mongrel grim,
Hound or spaniel, brach or lym,
Or bobtail tike or trundle-tail,
Tom will make them weep and wail:
For, with throwing thus my head,
Dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled.
Do de, de, de. Sessa! Come, march to wakes and
fairs and market-towns. Poor Tom, thy horn is dry.


KING LEAR

Then let them anatomize Regan; see what breeds
about her heart. Is there any cause in nature that
makes these hard hearts?
To EDGAR
You, sir, I entertain for one of my hundred; only I
do not like the fashion of your garments: you will
say they are Persian attire: but let them be changed.


KENT

Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.


KING LEAR

Make no noise, make no noise; draw the curtains:
so, so, so. We'll go to supper i' he morning. So, so, so.


Fool

And I'll go to bed at noon.
Re-enter GLOUCESTER


GLOUCESTER

Come hither, friend: where is the king my master?


KENT

Here, sir; but trouble him not, his wits are gone.


GLOUCESTER

Good friend, I prithee, take him in thy arms;
I have o'erheard a plot of death upon him:
There is a litter ready; lay him in 't,
And drive towards Dover, friend, where thou shalt meet
Both welcome and protection. Take up thy master:
If thou shouldst dally half an hour, his life,
With thine, and all that offer to defend him,
Stand in assured loss: take up, take up;
And follow me, that will to some provision
Give thee quick conduct.


KENT

Oppressed nature sleeps:
This rest might yet have balm'd thy broken senses,
Which, if convenience will not allow,
Stand in hard cure.
To the Fool
Come, help to bear thy master;
Thou must not stay behind.


GLOUCESTER

Come, come, away.
Exeunt all but EDGAR


EDGAR

When we our betters see bearing our woes,
We scarcely think our miseries our foes.
Who alone suffers suffers most i' the mind,
Leaving free things and happy shows behind:
But then the mind much sufferance doth o'er skip,
When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.
How light and portable my pain seems now,
When that which makes me bend makes the king bow,
He childed as I father'd! Tom, away!
Mark the high noises; and thyself bewray,
When false opinion, whose wrong thought defiles thee,
In thy just proof, repeals and reconciles thee.
What will hap more to-night, safe 'scape the king!
Lurk, lurk.
Exit

SCENE VII. Gloucester's castle.

Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, GONERIL, EDMUND, and Servants


CORNWALL

Post speedily to my lord your husband; show him
this letter: the army of France is landed. Seek
out the villain Gloucester.
Exeunt some of the Servants


REGAN

Hang him instantly.


GONERIL

Pluck out his eyes.


CORNWALL

Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund, keep you our
sister company: the revenges we are bound to take
upon your traitorous father are not fit for your
beholding. Advise the duke, where you are going, to
a most festinate preparation: we are bound to the
like. Our posts shall be swift and intelligent
betwixt us. Farewell, dear sister: farewell, my
lord of Gloucester.
Enter OSWALD
How now! where's the king?


OSWALD

My lord of Gloucester hath convey'd him hence:
Some five or six and thirty of his knights,
Hot questrists after him, met him at gate;
Who, with some other of the lords dependants,
Are gone with him towards Dover; where they boast
To have well-armed friends.


CORNWALL

Get horses for your mistress.


GONERIL

Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.


CORNWALL

Edmund, farewell.
Exeunt GONERIL, EDMUND, and OSWALD
Go seek the traitor Gloucester,
Pinion him like a thief, bring him before us.
Exeunt other Servants
Though well we may not pass upon his life
Without the form of justice, yet our power
Shall do a courtesy to our wrath, which men
May blame, but not control. Who's there? the traitor?
Enter GLOUCESTER, brought in by two or three


REGAN

Ingrateful fox! 'tis he.


CORNWALL

Bind fast his corky arms.


GLOUCESTER

What mean your graces? Good my friends, consider
You are my guests: do me no foul play, friends.


CORNWALL

Bind him, I say.
Servants bind him


REGAN

                  Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!


GLOUCESTER

Unmerciful lady as you are, I'm none.


CORNWALL

To this chair bind him. Villain, thou shalt find--
REGAN plucks his beard


GLOUCESTER

By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done
To pluck me by the beard.


REGAN

So white, and such a traitor!


GLOUCESTER

Naughty lady,
These hairs, which thou dost ravish from my chin,
Will quicken, and accuse thee: I am your host:
With robbers' hands my hospitable favours
You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?


CORNWALL

Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?


REGAN

Be simple answerer, for we know the truth.


CORNWALL

And what confederacy have you with the traitors
Late footed in the kingdom?


REGAN

To whose hands have you sent the lunatic king? Speak.


GLOUCESTER

I have a letter guessingly set down,
Which came from one that's of a neutral heart,
And not from one opposed.


CORNWALL

Cunning.


REGAN

And false.


CORNWALL

Where hast thou sent the king?


GLOUCESTER

To Dover.


REGAN

Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charged at peril--


CORNWALL

Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.


GLOUCESTER

I am tied to the stake, and I must stand the course.


REGAN

Wherefore to Dover, sir?


GLOUCESTER

Because I would not see thy cruel nails
Pluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sister
In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.
The sea, with such a storm as his bare head
In hell-black night endured, would have buoy'd up,
And quench'd the stelled fires:
Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.
If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time,
Thou shouldst have said 'Good porter, turn the key,'
All cruels else subscribed: but I shall see
The winged vengeance overtake such children.


CORNWALL

See't shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair.
Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.


GLOUCESTER

He that will think to live till he be old,
Give me some help! O cruel! O you gods!


REGAN

One side will mock another; the other too.


CORNWALL

If you see vengeance,--


First Servant

Hold your hand, my lord:
I have served you ever since I was a child;
But better service have I never done you
Than now to bid you hold.


REGAN

How now, you dog!


First Servant

If you did wear a beard upon your chin,
I'd shake it on this quarrel. What do you mean?


CORNWALL

My villain!
They draw and fight


First Servant

Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.


REGAN

Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus!
Takes a sword, and runs at him behind


First Servant

O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left
To see some mischief on him. O!
Dies


CORNWALL

Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!
Where is thy lustre now?


GLOUCESTER

All dark and comfortless. Where's my son Edmund?
Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature,
To quit this horrid act.


REGAN

Out, treacherous villain!
Thou call'st on him that hates thee: it was he
That made the overture of thy treasons to us;
Who is too good to pity thee.


GLOUCESTER

O my follies! then Edgar was abused.
Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!


REGAN

Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell
His way to Dover.
Exit one with GLOUCESTER
How is't, my lord? how look you?


CORNWALL

I have received a hurt: follow me, lady.
Turn out that eyeless villain; throw this slave
Upon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace:
Untimely comes this hurt: give me your arm.
Exit CORNWALL, led by REGAN


Second Servant

I'll never care what wickedness I do,
If this man come to good.


Third Servant

If she live long,
And in the end meet the old course of death,
Women will all turn monsters.


Second Servant

Let's follow the old earl, and get the Bedlam
To lead him where he would: his roguish madness
Allows itself to any thing.


Third Servant

Go thou: I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs
To apply to his bleeding face. Now, heaven help him!
Exeunt severally

ACT IV
SCENE I. The heath.

Enter EDGAR


EDGAR

Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd,
Than still contemn'd and flatter'd. To be worst,
The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,
Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear:
The lamentable change is from the best;
The worst returns to laughter. Welcome, then,
Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace!
The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst
Owes nothing to thy blasts. But who comes here?
Enter GLOUCESTER, led by an Old Man
My father, poorly led? World, world, O world!
But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,
Lie would not yield to age.


Old Man

O, my good lord, I have been your tenant, and
your father's tenant, these fourscore years.


GLOUCESTER

Away, get thee away; good friend, be gone:
Thy comforts can do me no good at all;
Thee they may hurt.


Old Man

Alack, sir, you cannot see your way.


GLOUCESTER

I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;
I stumbled when I saw: full oft 'tis seen,
Our means secure us, and our mere defects
Prove our commodities. O dear son Edgar,
The food of thy abused father's wrath!
Might I but live to see thee in my touch,
I'ld say I had eyes again!


Old Man

How now! Who's there?


EDGAR

[Aside]  O gods! Who is't can say 'I am at
the worst'?
I am worse than e'er I was.


Old Man

'Tis poor mad Tom.


EDGAR

[Aside]  And worse I may be yet: the worst is not
So long as we can say  'This is the worst.'


Old Man

Fellow, where goest?


GLOUCESTER

Is it a beggar-man?


Old Man

Madman and beggar too.


GLOUCESTER

He has some reason, else he could not beg.
I' the last night's storm I such a fellow saw;
Which made me think a man a worm: my son
Came then into my mind; and yet my mind
Was then scarce friends with him: I have heard
more since.
As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods.
They kill us for their sport.


EDGAR

[Aside]	How should this be?
Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,
Angering itself and others.--Bless thee, master!


GLOUCESTER

Is that the naked fellow?


Old Man

Ay, my lord.


GLOUCESTER

Then, prithee, get thee gone: if, for my sake,
Thou wilt o'ertake us, hence a mile or twain,
I' the way toward Dover, do it for ancient love;
And bring some covering for this naked soul,
Who I'll entreat to lead me.


Old Man

Alack, sir, he is mad.


GLOUCESTER

'Tis the times' plague, when madmen lead the blind.
Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure;
Above the rest, be gone.


Old Man

I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have,
Come on't what will.
Exit


GLOUCESTER

Sirrah, naked fellow,--


EDGAR

Poor Tom's a-cold.
Aside
I cannot daub it further.


GLOUCESTER

Come hither, fellow.


EDGAR

[Aside]  And yet I must.--Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.


GLOUCESTER

Know'st thou the way to Dover?


EDGAR

Both stile and gate, horse-way and foot-path. Poor
Tom hath been scared out of his good wits: bless
thee, good man's son, from the foul fiend! five
fiends have been in poor Tom at once; of lust, as
Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of dumbness; Mahu, of
stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of
mopping and mowing, who since possesses chambermaids
and waiting-women. So, bless thee, master!


GLOUCESTER

Here, take this purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues
Have humbled to all strokes: that I am wretched
Makes thee the happier: heavens, deal so still!
Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,
That slaves your ordinance, that will not see
Because he doth not feel, feel your power quickly;
So distribution should undo excess,
And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?


EDGAR

Ay, master.


GLOUCESTER

There is a cliff, whose high and bending head
Looks fearfully in the confined deep:
Bring me but to the very brim of it,
And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear
With something rich about me: from that place
I shall no leading need.


EDGAR

Give me thy arm:
Poor Tom shall lead thee.
Exeunt

SCENE II. Before ALBANY's palace.

Enter GONERIL and EDMUND


GONERIL

Welcome, my lord: I marvel our mild husband
Not met us on the way.
Enter OSWALD
Now, where's your master'?


OSWALD

Madam, within; but never man so changed.
I told him of the army that was landed;
He smiled at it: I told him you were coming:
His answer was 'The worse:' of Gloucester's treachery,
And of the loyal service of his son,
When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot,
And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out:
What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;
What like, offensive.


GONERIL

[To EDMUND]  Then shall you go no further.
It is the cowish terror of his spirit,
That dares not undertake: he'll not feel wrongs
Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way
May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;
Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:
I must change arms at home, and give the distaff
Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant
Shall pass between us: ere long you are like to hear,
If you dare venture in your own behalf,
A mistress's command. Wear this; spare speech;
Giving a favour
Decline your head: this kiss, if it durst speak,
Would stretch thy spirits up into the air:
Conceive, and fare thee well.


EDMUND

Yours in the ranks of death.


GONERIL

My most dear Gloucester!
Exit EDMUND
O, the difference of man and man!
To thee a woman's services are due:
My fool usurps my body.


OSWALD

Madam, here comes my lord.
Exit
Enter ALBANY


GONERIL

I have been worth the whistle.


ALBANY

O Goneril!
You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:
That nature, which contemns its origin,
Cannot be border'd certain in itself;
She that herself will sliver and disbranch
From her material sap, perforce must wither
And come to deadly use.


GONERIL

No more; the text is foolish.


ALBANY

Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile:
Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?
Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?
A father, and a gracious aged man,
Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,
Most barbarous, most degenerate! have you madded.
Could my good brother suffer you to do it?
A man, a prince, by him so benefited!
If that the heavens do not their visible spirits
Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,
It will come,
Humanity must perforce prey on itself,
Like monsters of the deep.


GONERIL

Milk-liver'd man!
That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;
Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st
Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd
Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
France spreads his banners in our noiseless land;
With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats;
Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest
'Alack, why does he so?'


ALBANY

See thyself, devil!
Proper deformity seems not in the fiend
So horrid as in woman.


GONERIL

O vain fool!


ALBANY

Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame,
Be-monster not thy feature. Were't my fitness
To let these hands obey my blood,
They are apt enough to dislocate and tear
Thy flesh and bones: howe'er thou art a fiend,
A woman's shape doth shield thee.


GONERIL

Marry, your manhood now--
Enter a Messenger


ALBANY

What news?


Messenger

O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead:
Slain by his servant, going to put out
The other eye of Gloucester.


ALBANY

Gloucester's eye!


Messenger

A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,
Opposed against the act, bending his sword
To his great master; who, thereat enraged,
Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;
But not without that harmful stroke, which since
Hath pluck'd him after.


ALBANY

This shows you are above,
You justicers, that these our nether crimes
So speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester!
Lost he his other eye?


Messenger

Both, both, my lord.
This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer;
'Tis from your sister.


GONERIL

[Aside]              One way I like this well;
But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,
May all the building in my fancy pluck
Upon my hateful life: another way,
The news is not so tart.--I'll read, and answer.
Exit


ALBANY

Where was his son when they did take his eyes?


Messenger

Come with my lady hither.


ALBANY

He is not here.


Messenger

No, my good lord; I met him back again.


ALBANY

Knows he the wickedness?


Messenger

Ay, my good lord; 'twas he inform'd against him;
And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment
Might have the freer course.


ALBANY

Gloucester, I live
To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the king,
And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend:
Tell me what more thou know'st.
Exeunt

SCENE III. The French camp near Dover.

Enter KENT and a Gentleman


KENT

Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back
know you the reason?


Gentleman

Something he left imperfect in the
state, which since his coming forth is thought
of; which imports to the kingdom so much
fear and danger, that his personal return was
most required and necessary.


KENT

Who hath he left behind him general?


Gentleman

The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.


KENT

Did your letters pierce the queen to any
demonstration of grief?


Gentleman

Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;
And now and then an ample tear trill'd down
Her delicate cheek: it seem'd she was a queen
Over her passion; who, most rebel-like,
Sought to be king o'er her.


KENT

O, then it moved her.


Gentleman

Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove
Who should express her goodliest. You have seen
Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears
Were like a better way: those happy smilets,
That play'd on her ripe lip, seem'd not to know
What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,
As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,
Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,
If all could so become it.


KENT

Made she no verbal question?


Gentleman

'Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of 'father'
Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart:
Cried 'Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!
Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?
Let pity not be believed!' There she shook
The holy water from her heavenly eyes,
And clamour moisten'd: then away she started
To deal with grief alone.


KENT

It is the stars,
The stars above us, govern our conditions;
Else one self mate and mate could not beget
Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?


Gentleman

No.


KENT

Was this before the king return'd?


Gentleman

No, since.


KENT

Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' the town;
Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers
What we are come about, and by no means
Will yield to see his daughter.


Gentleman

Why, good sir?


KENT

A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,
That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her
To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights
To his dog-hearted daughters, these things sting
His mind so venomously, that burning shame
Detains him from Cordelia.


Gentleman

Alack, poor gentleman!


KENT

Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?


Gentleman

'Tis so, they are afoot.


KENT

Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear,
And leave you to attend him: some dear cause
Will in concealment wrap me up awhile;
When I am known aright, you shall not grieve
Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go
Along with me.
Exeunt

SCENE IV. The same. A tent.

Enter, with drum and colours, CORDELIA, Doctor, and Soldiers


CORDELIA

Alack, 'tis he: why, he was met even now
As mad as the vex'd sea; singing aloud;
Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,
With bur-docks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,
Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow
In our sustaining corn. A century send forth;
Search every acre in the high-grown field,
And bring him to our eye.
Exit an Officer
What can man's wisdom
In the restoring his bereaved sense?
He that helps him take all my outward worth.


Doctor

There is means, madam:
Our foster-nurse of nature is repose,
The which he lacks; that to provoke in him,
Are many simples operative, whose power
Will close the eye of anguish.


CORDELIA

All blest secrets,
All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth,
Spring with my tears! be aidant and remediate
In the good man's distress! Seek, seek for him;
Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life
That wants the means to lead it.
Enter a Messenger


Messenger

News, madam;
The British powers are marching hitherward.


CORDELIA

'Tis known before; our preparation stands
In expectation of them. O dear father,
It is thy business that I go about;
Therefore great France
My mourning and important tears hath pitied.
No blown ambition doth our arms incite,
But love, dear love, and our aged father's right:
Soon may I hear and see him!
Exeunt

SCENE V. Gloucester's castle.

Enter REGAN and OSWALD


REGAN

But are my brother's powers set forth?


OSWALD

Ay, madam.


REGAN

Himself in person there?


OSWALD

Madam, with much ado:
Your sister is the better soldier.


REGAN

Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?


OSWALD

No, madam.


REGAN

What might import my sister's letter to him?


OSWALD

I know not, lady.


REGAN

'Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.
It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,
To let him live: where he arrives he moves
All hearts against us: Edmund, I think, is gone,
In pity of his misery, to dispatch
His nighted life: moreover, to descry
The strength o' the enemy.


OSWALD

I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.


REGAN

Our troops set forth to-morrow: stay with us;
The ways are dangerous.


OSWALD

I may not, madam:
My lady charged my duty in this business.


REGAN

Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you
Transport her purposes by word? Belike,
Something--I know not what: I'll love thee much,
Let me unseal the letter.


OSWALD

Madam, I had rather--


REGAN

I know your lady does not love her husband;
I am sure of that: and at her late being here
She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks
To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.


OSWALD

I, madam?


REGAN

I speak in understanding; you are; I know't:
Therefore I do advise you, take this note:
My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd;
And more convenient is he for my hand
Than for your lady's: you may gather more.
If you do find him, pray you, give him this;
And when your mistress hears thus much from you,
I pray, desire her call her wisdom to her.
So, fare you well.
If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,
Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.


OSWALD

Would I could meet him, madam! I should show
What party I do follow.


REGAN

Fare thee well.
Exeunt

SCENE VI. Fields near Dover.

Enter GLOUCESTER, and EDGAR dressed like a peasant


GLOUCESTER

When shall we come to the top of that same hill?


EDGAR

You do climb up it now: look, how we labour.


GLOUCESTER

Methinks the ground is even.


EDGAR

Horrible steep.
Hark, do you hear the sea?


GLOUCESTER

No, truly.


EDGAR

Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect
By your eyes' anguish.


GLOUCESTER

So may it be, indeed:
Methinks thy voice is alter'd; and thou speak'st
In better phrase and matter than thou didst.


EDGAR

You're much deceived: in nothing am I changed
But in my garments.


GLOUCESTER

Methinks you're better spoken.


EDGAR

Come on, sir; here's the place: stand still. How fearful
And dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eyes so low!
The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down
Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!
Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:
The fishermen, that walk upon the beach,
Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,
Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy
Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge,
That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,
Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more;
Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight
Topple down headlong.


GLOUCESTER

Set me where you stand.


EDGAR

Give me your hand: you are now within a foot
Of the extreme verge: for all beneath the moon
Would I not leap upright.


GLOUCESTER

Let go my hand.
Here, friend, 's another purse; in it a jewel
Well worth a poor man's taking: fairies and gods
Prosper it with thee! Go thou farther off;
Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.


EDGAR

Now fare you well, good sir.


GLOUCESTER

With all my heart.


EDGAR

Why I do trifle thus with his despair
Is done to cure it.


GLOUCESTER

[Kneeling]  O you mighty gods!
This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,
Shake patiently my great affliction off:
If I could bear it longer, and not fall
To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,
My snuff and loathed part of nature should
Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!
Now, fellow, fare thee well.
He falls forward


EDGAR

Gone, sir: farewell.
And yet I know not how conceit may rob
The treasury of life, when life itself
Yields to the theft: had he been where he thought,
By this, had thought been past. Alive or dead?
Ho, you sir! friend! Hear you, sir! speak!
Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.
What are you, sir?


GLOUCESTER

                  Away, and let me die.


EDGAR

Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,
So many fathom down precipitating,
Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg: but thou dost breathe;
Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.
Ten masts at each make not the altitude
Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:
Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.


GLOUCESTER

But have I fall'n, or no?


EDGAR

From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
Look up a-height; the shrill-gorged lark so far
Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.


GLOUCESTER

Alack, I have no eyes.
Is wretchedness deprived that benefit,
To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort,
When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage,
And frustrate his proud will.


EDGAR

Give me your arm:
Up: so. How is 't? Feel you your legs? You stand.


GLOUCESTER

Too well, too well.


EDGAR

This is above all strangeness.
Upon the crown o' the cliff, what thing was that
Which parted from you?


GLOUCESTER

A poor unfortunate beggar.


EDGAR

As I stood here below, methought his eyes
Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,
Horns whelk'd and waved like the enridged sea:
It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,
Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours
Of men's impossibilities, have preserved thee.


GLOUCESTER

I do remember now: henceforth I'll bear
Affliction till it do cry out itself
'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,
I took it for a man; often 'twould say
'The fiend, the fiend:' he led me to that place.


EDGAR

Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?
Enter KING LEAR, fantastically dressed with wild flowers
The safer sense will ne'er accommodate
His master thus.


KING LEAR

No, they cannot touch me for coining; I am the
king himself.


EDGAR

O thou side-piercing sight!


KING LEAR

Nature's above art in that respect. There's your
press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a
crow-keeper: draw me a clothier's yard. Look,
look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this piece of toasted
cheese will do 't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove
it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well
flown, bird! i' the clout, i' the clout: hewgh!
Give the word.


EDGAR

Sweet marjoram.


KING LEAR

Pass.


GLOUCESTER

I know that voice.


KING LEAR

Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flattered
me like a dog; and told me I had white hairs in my
beard ere the black ones were there. To say 'ay'
and 'no' to every thing that I said!--'Ay' and 'no'
too was no good divinity. When the rain came to
wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when
the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I
found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to, they are
not men o' their words: they told me I was every
thing; 'tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.


GLOUCESTER

The trick of that voice I do well remember:
Is 't not the king?


KING LEAR

Ay, every inch a king:
When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.
I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause? Adultery?
Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:
The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded fly
Does lecher in my sight.
Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son
Was kinder to his father than my daughters
Got 'tween the lawful sheets.
To 't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.
Behold yond simpering dame,
Whose face between her forks presages snow;
That minces virtue, and does shake the head
To hear of pleasure's name;
The fitchew, nor the soiled horse, goes to 't
With a more riotous appetite.
Down from the waist they are Centaurs,
Though women all above:
But to the girdle do the gods inherit,
Beneath is all the fiends';
There's hell, there's darkness, there's the
sulphurous pit,
Burning, scalding, stench, consumption; fie,
fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet,
good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination:
there's money for thee.


GLOUCESTER

O, let me kiss that hand!


KING LEAR

Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.


GLOUCESTER

O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world
Shall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?


KING LEAR

I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny
at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not
love. Read thou this challenge; mark but the
penning of it.


GLOUCESTER

Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.


EDGAR

I would not take this from report; it is,
And my heart breaks at it.


KING LEAR

Read.


GLOUCESTER

What, with the case of eyes?


KING LEAR

O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your
head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in
a heavy case, your purse in a light; yet you see how
this world goes.


GLOUCESTER

I see it feelingly.


KING LEAR

What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes
with no eyes. Look with thine ears: see how yond
justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark, in
thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which
is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen
a farmer's dog bark at a beggar?


GLOUCESTER

Ay, sir.


KING LEAR

And the creature run from the cur? There thou
mightst behold the great image of authority: a
dog's obeyed in office.
Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!
Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;
Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind
For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.
Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;
Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks:
Arm it in rags, a pigmy's straw does pierce it.
None does offend, none, I say, none; I'll able 'em:
Take that of me, my friend, who have the power
To seal the accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes;
And like a scurvy politician, seem
To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now:
Pull off my boots: harder, harder: so.


EDGAR

O, matter and impertinency mix'd! Reason in madness!


KING LEAR

If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.
I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester:
Thou must be patient; we came crying hither:
Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air,
We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.


GLOUCESTER

Alack, alack the day!


KING LEAR

When we are born, we cry that we are come
To this great stage of fools: this a good block;
It were a delicate stratagem, to shoe
A troop of horse with felt: I'll put 't in proof;
And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,
Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!
Enter a Gentleman, with Attendants


Gentleman

O, here he is: lay hand upon him. Sir,
Your most dear daughter--


KING LEAR

No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even
The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;
You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;
I am cut to the brains.


Gentleman

You shall have any thing.


KING LEAR

No seconds? all myself?
Why, this would make a man a man of salt,
To use his eyes for garden water-pots,
Ay, and laying autumn's dust.


Gentleman

Good sir,--


KING LEAR

I will die bravely, like a bridegroom. What!
I will be jovial: come, come; I am a king,
My masters, know you that.


Gentleman

You are a royal one, and we obey you.


KING LEAR

Then there's life in't. Nay, if you get it, you
shall get it with running. Sa, sa, sa, sa.
Exit running; Attendants follow


Gentleman

A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,
Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter,
Who redeems nature from the general curse
Which twain have brought her to.


EDGAR

Hail, gentle sir.


Gentleman

                  Sir, speed you: what's your will?


EDGAR

Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?


Gentleman

Most sure and vulgar: every one hears that,
Which can distinguish sound.


EDGAR

But, by your favour,
How near's the other army?


Gentleman

Near and on speedy foot; the main descry
Stands on the hourly thought.


EDGAR

I thank you, sir: that's all.


Gentleman

Though that the queen on special cause is here,
Her army is moved on.


EDGAR

I thank you, sir.
Exit Gentleman


GLOUCESTER

You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me:
Let not my worser spirit tempt me again
To die before you please!


EDGAR

Well pray you, father.


GLOUCESTER

Now, good sir, what are you?


EDGAR

A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows;
Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,
Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand,
I'll lead you to some biding.


GLOUCESTER

Hearty thanks:
The bounty and the benison of heaven
To boot, and boot!
Enter OSWALD


OSWALD

A proclaim'd prize! Most happy!
That eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh
To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,
Briefly thyself remember: the sword is out
That must destroy thee.


GLOUCESTER

Now let thy friendly hand
Put strength enough to't.
EDGAR interposes


OSWALD

Wherefore, bold peasant,
Darest thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence;
Lest that the infection of his fortune take
Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.


EDGAR

Ch'ill not let go, zir, without vurther 'casion.


OSWALD

Let go, slave, or thou diest!


EDGAR

Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor volk
pass. An chud ha' bin zwaggered out of my life,
'twould not ha' bin zo long as 'tis by a vortnight.
Nay, come not near th' old man; keep out, che vor
ye, or ise try whether your costard or my ballow be
the harder: ch'ill be plain with you.


OSWALD

Out, dunghill!


EDGAR

Ch'ill pick your teeth, zir: come; no matter vor
your foins.
They fight, and EDGAR knocks him down


OSWALD

Slave, thou hast slain me: villain, take my purse:
If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body;
And give the letters which thou find'st about me
To Edmund earl of Gloucester; seek him out
Upon the British party: O, untimely death!
Dies


EDGAR

I know thee well: a serviceable villain;
As duteous to the vices of thy mistress
As badness would desire.


GLOUCESTER

What, is he dead?


EDGAR

Sit you down, father; rest you
Let's see these pockets: the letters that he speaks of
May be my friends. He's dead; I am only sorry
He had no other death's-man. Let us see:
Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not:
To know our enemies' minds, we'ld rip their hearts;
Their papers, is more lawful.
Reads
'Let our reciprocal vows be remembered. You have
many opportunities to cut him off: if your will
want not, time and place will be fruitfully offered.
There is nothing done, if he return the conqueror:
then am I the prisoner, and his bed my goal; from
the loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply
the place for your labour.
'Your--wife, so I would say--
'Affectionate servant,
'GONERIL.'
O undistinguish'd space of woman's will!
A plot upon her virtuous husband's life;
And the exchange my brother! Here, in the sands,
Thee I'll rake up, the post unsanctified
Of murderous lechers: and in the mature time
With this ungracious paper strike the sight
Of the death practised duke: for him 'tis well
That of thy death and business I can tell.


GLOUCESTER

The king is mad: how stiff is my vile sense,
That I stand up, and have ingenious feeling
Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract:
So should my thoughts be sever'd from my griefs,
And woes by wrong imaginations lose
The knowledge of themselves.


EDGAR

Give me your hand:
Drum afar off
Far off, methinks, I hear the beaten drum:
Come, father, I'll bestow you with a friend.
Exeunt

SCENE VII. A tent in the French camp. LEAR on a bed asleep,

soft music playing; Gentleman, and others attending.
Enter CORDELIA, KENT, and Doctor


CORDELIA

O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work,
To match thy goodness? My life will be too short,
And every measure fail me.


KENT

To be acknowledged, madam, is o'erpaid.
All my reports go with the modest truth;
Nor more nor clipp'd, but so.


CORDELIA

Be better suited:
These weeds are memories of those worser hours:
I prithee, put them off.


KENT

Pardon me, dear madam;
Yet to be known shortens my made intent:
My boon I make it, that you know me not
Till time and I think meet.


CORDELIA

Then be't so, my good lord.
To the Doctor
How does the king?


Doctor

Madam, sleeps still.


CORDELIA

O you kind gods,
Cure this great breach in his abused nature!
The untuned and jarring senses, O, wind up
Of this child-changed father!


Doctor

So please your majesty
That we may wake the king: he hath slept long.


CORDELIA

Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed
I' the sway of your own will. Is he array'd?


Gentleman

Ay, madam; in the heaviness of his sleep
We put fresh garments on him.


Doctor

Be by, good madam, when we do awake him;
I doubt not of his temperance.


CORDELIA

Very well.


Doctor

Please you, draw near. Louder the music there!


CORDELIA

O my dear father! Restoration hang
Thy medicine on my lips; and let this kiss
Repair those violent harms that my two sisters
Have in thy reverence made!


KENT

Kind and dear princess!


CORDELIA

Had you not been their father, these white flakes
Had challenged pity of them. Was this a face
To be opposed against the warring winds?
To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?
In the most terrible and nimble stroke
Of quick, cross lightning? to watch--poor perdu!--
With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,
Though he had bit me, should have stood that night
Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,
To hovel thee with swine, and rogues forlorn,
In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!
'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
Had not concluded all. He wakes; speak to him.


Doctor

Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.


CORDELIA

How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty?


KING LEAR

You do me wrong to take me out o' the grave:
Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound
Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears
Do scald like moulten lead.


CORDELIA

Sir, do you know me?


KING LEAR

You are a spirit, I know: when did you die?


CORDELIA

Still, still, far wide!


Doctor

He's scarce awake: let him alone awhile.


KING LEAR

Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?
I am mightily abused. I should e'en die with pity,
To see another thus. I know not what to say.
I will not swear these are my hands: let's see;
I feel this pin prick. Would I were assured
Of my condition!


CORDELIA

                  O, look upon me, sir,
And hold your hands in benediction o'er me:
No, sir, you must not kneel.


KING LEAR

Pray, do not mock me:
I am a very foolish fond old man,
Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;
And, to deal plainly,
I fear I am not in my perfect mind.
Methinks I should know you, and know this man;
Yet I am doubtful for I am mainly ignorant
What place this is; and all the skill I have
Remembers not these garments; nor I know not
Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;
For, as I am a man, I think this lady
To be my child Cordelia.


CORDELIA

And so I am, I am.


KING LEAR

Be your tears wet? yes, 'faith. I pray, weep not:
If you have poison for me, I will drink it.
I know you do not love me; for your sisters
Have, as I do remember, done me wrong:
You have some cause, they have not.


CORDELIA

No cause, no cause.


KING LEAR

Am I in France?


KENT

                  In your own kingdom, sir.


KING LEAR

Do not abuse me.


Doctor

Be comforted, good madam: the great rage,
You see, is kill'd in him: and yet it is danger
To make him even o'er the time he has lost.
Desire him to go in; trouble him no more
Till further settling.


CORDELIA

Will't please your highness walk?


KING LEAR

You must bear with me:
Pray you now, forget and forgive: I am old and foolish.
Exeunt all but KENT and Gentleman


Gentleman

Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?


KENT

Most certain, sir.


Gentleman

Who is conductor of his people?


KENT

As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.


Gentleman

They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the Earl
of Kent in Germany.


KENT

Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about; the
powers of the kingdom approach apace.


Gentleman

The arbitrement is like to be bloody. Fare you
well, sir.
Exit


KENT

My point and period will be throughly wrought,
Or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought.
Exit

ACT V
SCENE I. The British camp, near Dover.

Enter, with drum and colours, EDMUND, REGAN, Gentlemen, and Soldiers.


EDMUND

Know of the duke if his last purpose hold,
Or whether since he is advised by aught
To change the course: he's full of alteration
And self-reproving: bring his constant pleasure.
To a Gentleman, who goes out


REGAN

Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.


EDMUND

'Tis to be doubted, madam.


REGAN

Now, sweet lord,
You know the goodness I intend upon you:
Tell me--but truly--but then speak the truth,
Do you not love my sister?


EDMUND

In honour'd love.


REGAN

But have you never found my brother's way
To the forfended place?


EDMUND

That thought abuses you.


REGAN

I am doubtful that you have been conjunct
And bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers.


EDMUND

No, by mine honour, madam.


REGAN

I never shall endure her: dear my lord,
Be not familiar with her.


EDMUND

Fear me not:
She and the duke her husband!
Enter, with drum and colours, ALBANY, GONERIL, and Soldiers


GONERIL

[Aside]  I had rather lose the battle than that sister
Should loosen him and me.


ALBANY

Our very loving sister, well be-met.
Sir, this I hear; the king is come to his daughter,
With others whom the rigor of our state
Forced to cry out. Where I could not be honest,
I never yet was valiant: for this business,
It toucheth us, as France invades our land,
Not bolds the king, with others, whom, I fear,
Most just and heavy causes make oppose.


EDMUND

Sir, you speak nobly.


REGAN

Why is this reason'd?


GONERIL

Combine together 'gainst the enemy;
For these domestic and particular broils
Are not the question here.


ALBANY

Let's then determine
With the ancient of war on our proceedings.


EDMUND

I shall attend you presently at your tent.


REGAN

Sister, you'll go with us?


GONERIL

No.


REGAN

'Tis most convenient; pray you, go with us.


GONERIL

[Aside]  O, ho, I know the riddle.--I will go.
As they are going out, enter EDGAR disguised


EDGAR

If e'er your grace had speech with man so poor,
Hear me one word.


ALBANY

                  I'll overtake you. Speak.
Exeunt all but ALBANY and EDGAR


EDGAR

Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.
If you have victory, let the trumpet sound
For him that brought it: wretched though I seem,
I can produce a champion that will prove
What is avouched there. If you miscarry,
Your business of the world hath so an end,
And machination ceases. Fortune love you.


ALBANY

Stay till I have read the letter.


EDGAR

I was forbid it.
When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,
And I'll appear again.


ALBANY

Why, fare thee well: I will o'erlook thy paper.
Exit EDGAR
Re-enter EDMUND


EDMUND

The enemy's in view; draw up your powers.
Here is the guess of their true strength and forces
By diligent discovery; but your haste
Is now urged on you.


ALBANY

We will greet the time.
Exit


EDMUND

To both these sisters have I sworn my love;
Each jealous of the other, as the stung
Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?
Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd,
If both remain alive: to take the widow
Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;
And hardly shall I carry out my side,
Her husband being alive. Now then we'll use
His countenance for the battle; which being done,
Let her who would be rid of him devise
His speedy taking off. As for the mercy
Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,
The battle done, and they within our power,
Shall never see his pardon; for my state
Stands on me to defend, not to debate.
Exit

SCENE II. A field between the two camps.

Alarum within. Enter, with drum and colours,  KING LEAR, CORDELIA, and Soldiers, over the stage; and exeunt


Enter EDGAR and GLOUCESTER


EDGAR

Here, father, take the shadow of this tree
For your good host; pray that the right may thrive:
If ever I return to you again,
I'll bring you comfort.


GLOUCESTER

Grace go with you, sir!
Exit EDGAR
Alarum and retreat within. Re-enter EDGAR


EDGAR

Away, old man; give me thy hand; away!
King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en:
Give me thy hand; come on.


GLOUCESTER

No farther, sir; a man may rot even here.


EDGAR

What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure
Their going hence, even as their coming hither;
Ripeness is all: come on.


GLOUCESTER

And that's true too.
Exeunt

SCENE III. The British camp near Dover.

Enter, in conquest, with drum and colours, EDMUND,  KING LEAR and CORDELIA, prisoners; Captain, Soldiers,  & c


EDMUND

Some officers take them away: good guard,
Until their greater pleasures first be known
That are to censure them.


CORDELIA

We are not the first
Who, with best meaning, have incurr'd the worst.
For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down;
Myself could else out-frown false fortune's frown.
Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?


KING LEAR

No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison:
We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage:
When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down,
And ask of thee forgiveness: so we'll live,
And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues
Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too,
Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out;
And take upon's the mystery of things,
As if we were God's spies: and we'll wear out,
In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones,
That ebb and flow by the moon.


EDMUND

Take them away.


KING LEAR

Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,
The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?
He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven,
And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes;
The good-years shall devour them, flesh and fell,
Ere they shall make us weep: we'll see 'em starve
first. Come.
Exeunt KING LEAR and CORDELIA, guarded


EDMUND

Come hither, captain; hark.
Take thou this note;
Giving a paper
go follow them to prison:
One step I have advanced thee; if thou dost
As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way
To noble fortunes: know thou this, that men
Are as the time is: to be tender-minded
Does not become a sword: thy great employment
Will not bear question; either say thou'lt do 't,
Or thrive by other means.


Captain

I'll do 't, my lord.


EDMUND

About it; and write happy when thou hast done.
Mark, I say, instantly; and carry it so
As I have set it down.


Captain

I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;
If it be man's work, I'll do 't.
Exit
Flourish. Enter ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, another Captain, and Soldiers


ALBANY

Sir, you have shown to-day your valiant strain,
And fortune led you well: you have the captives
That were the opposites of this day's strife:
We do require them of you, so to use them
As we shall find their merits and our safety
May equally determine.


EDMUND

Sir, I thought it fit
To send the old and miserable king
To some retention and appointed guard;
Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,
To pluck the common bosom on his side,
An turn our impress'd lances in our eyes
Which do command them. With him I sent the queen;
My reason all the same; and they are ready
To-morrow, or at further space, to appear
Where you shall hold your session. At this time
We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;
And the best quarrels, in the heat, are cursed
By those that feel their sharpness:
The question of Cordelia and her father
Requires a fitter place.


ALBANY

Sir, by your patience,
I hold you but a subject of this war,
Not as a brother.


REGAN

                  That's as we list to grace him.
Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded,
Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers;
Bore the commission of my place and person;
The which immediacy may well stand up,
And call itself your brother.


GONERIL

Not so hot:
In his own grace he doth exalt himself,
More than in your addition.


REGAN

In my rights,
By me invested, he compeers the best.


GONERIL

That were the most, if he should husband you.


REGAN

Jesters do oft prove prophets.


GONERIL

Holla, holla!
That eye that told you so look'd but a-squint.


REGAN

Lady, I am not well; else I should answer
From a full-flowing stomach. General,
Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;
Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine:
Witness the world, that I create thee here
My lord and master.


GONERIL

Mean you to enjoy him?


ALBANY

The let-alone lies not in your good will.


EDMUND

Nor in thine, lord.


ALBANY

Half-blooded fellow, yes.


REGAN

[To EDMUND]  Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.


ALBANY

Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee
On capital treason; and, in thine attaint,
This gilded serpent
Pointing to Goneril
For your claim, fair sister,
I bar it in the interest of my wife:
'Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord,
And I, her husband, contradict your bans.
If you will marry, make your loves to me,
My lady is bespoke.


GONERIL

An interlude!


ALBANY

Thou art arm'd, Gloucester: let the trumpet sound:
If none appear to prove upon thy head
Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,
There is my pledge;
Throwing down a glove
I'll prove it on thy heart,
Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
Than I have here proclaim'd thee.


REGAN

Sick, O, sick!


GONERIL

[Aside]  If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.


EDMUND

There's my exchange:
Throwing down a glove
what in the world he is
That names me traitor, villain-like he lies:
Call by thy trumpet: he that dares approach,
On him, on you, who not? I will maintain
My truth and honour firmly.


ALBANY

A herald, ho!


EDMUND

                  A herald, ho, a herald!


ALBANY

Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,
All levied in my name, have in my name
Took their discharge.


REGAN

My sickness grows upon me.


ALBANY

She is not well; convey her to  my tent.
Exit Regan, led
Enter a Herald
Come hither, herald,--Let the trumpet sound,
And read out this.


Captain

Sound, trumpet!
A trumpet sounds


Herald

[Reads]  'If any man of quality or degree within
the lists of the army will maintain upon Edmund,
supposed Earl of Gloucester, that he is a manifold
traitor, let him appear by the third sound of the
trumpet: he is bold in his defence.'


EDMUND

Sound!
First trumpet


Herald

Again!
Second trumpet


Herald

Again!
Third trumpet
Trumpet answers within
Enter EDGAR, at the third sound, armed, with a trumpet before him


ALBANY

Ask him his purposes, why he appears
Upon this call o' the trumpet.


Herald

What are you?
Your name, your quality? and why you answer
This present summons?


EDGAR

Know, my name is lost;
By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit:
Yet am I noble as the adversary
I come to cope.


ALBANY

                  Which is that adversary?


EDGAR

What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?


EDMUND

Himself: what say'st thou to him?


EDGAR

Draw thy sword,
That, if my speech offend a noble heart,
Thy arm may do thee justice: here is mine.
Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,
My oath, and my profession: I protest,
Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,
Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,
Thy valour and thy heart, thou art a traitor;
False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;
Conspirant 'gainst this high-illustrious prince;
And, from the extremest upward of thy head
To the descent and dust below thy foot,
A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'No,'
This sword, this arm, and my best spirits, are bent
To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,
Thou liest.


EDMUND

In wisdom I should ask thy name;
But, since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,
And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,
What safe and nicely I might well delay
By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn:
Back do I toss these treasons to thy head;
With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;
Which, for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,
This sword of mine shall give them instant way,
Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!
Alarums. They fight. EDMUND falls


ALBANY

Save him, save him!


GONERIL

This is practise, Gloucester:
By the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer
An unknown opposite; thou art not vanquish'd,
But cozen'd and beguiled.


ALBANY

Shut your mouth, dame,
Or with this paper shall I stop it: Hold, sir:
Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil:
No tearing, lady: I perceive you know it.
Gives the letter to EDMUND


GONERIL

Say, if I do, the laws are mine, not thine:
Who can arraign me for't.


ALBANY

Most monstrous! oh!
Know'st thou this paper?


GONERIL

Ask me not what I know.
Exit


ALBANY

Go after her: she's desperate; govern her.


EDMUND

What you have charged me with, that have I done;
And more, much more; the time will bring it out:
'Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou
That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,
I do forgive thee.


EDGAR

                  Let's exchange charity.
I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;
If more, the more thou hast wrong'd me.
My name is Edgar, and thy father's son.
The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices
Make instruments to plague us:
The dark and vicious place where thee he got
Cost him his eyes.


EDMUND

                  Thou hast spoken right, 'tis true;
The wheel is come full circle: I am here.


ALBANY

Methought thy very gait did prophesy
A royal nobleness: I must embrace thee:
Let sorrow split my heart, if ever I
Did hate thee or thy father!


EDGAR

Worthy prince, I know't.


ALBANY

Where have you hid yourself?
How have you known the miseries of your father?


EDGAR

By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;
And when 'tis told, O, that my heart would burst!
The bloody proclamation to escape,
That follow'd me so near,--O, our lives' sweetness!
That we the pain of death would hourly die
Rather than die at once!--taught me to shift
Into a madman's rags; to assume a semblance
That very dogs disdain'd: and in this habit
Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
Their precious stones new lost: became his guide,
Led him, begg'd for him, saved him from despair;
Never,--O fault!--reveal'd myself unto him,
Until some half-hour past, when I was arm'd:
Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,
I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart,
Alack, too weak the conflict to support!
'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
Burst smilingly.


EDMUND

This speech of yours hath moved me,
And shall perchance do good: but speak you on;
You look as you had something more to say.


ALBANY

If there be more, more woeful, hold it in;
For I am almost ready to dissolve,
Hearing of this.


EDGAR

                  This would have seem'd a period
To such as love not sorrow; but another,
To amplify too much, would make much more,
And top extremity.
Whilst I was big in clamour came there in a man,
Who, having seen me in my worst estate,
Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding
Who 'twas that so endured, with his strong arms
He fastened on my neck, and bellow'd out
As he'ld burst heaven; threw him on my father;
Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
That ever ear received: which in recounting
His grief grew puissant and the strings of life
Began to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded,
And there I left him tranced.


ALBANY

But who was this?


EDGAR

Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
Follow'd his enemy king, and did him service
Improper for a slave.
Enter a Gentleman, with a bloody knife


Gentleman

Help, help, O, help!


EDGAR

What kind of help?


ALBANY

Speak, man.


EDGAR

What means that bloody knife?


Gentleman

'Tis hot, it smokes;
It came even from the heart of--O, she's dead!


ALBANY

Who dead? speak, man.


Gentleman

Your lady, sir, your lady: and her sister
By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it.


EDMUND

I was contracted to them both: all three
Now marry in an instant.


EDGAR

Here comes Kent.


ALBANY

Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead:
This judgment of the heavens, that makes us tremble,
Touches us not with pity.
Exit Gentleman
Enter KENT
O, is this he?
The time will not allow the compliment
Which very manners urges.


KENT

I am come
To bid my king and master aye good night:
Is he not here?


ALBANY

                  Great thing of us forgot!
Speak, Edmund, where's the king? and where's Cordelia?
See'st thou this object, Kent?
The bodies of GONERIL and REGAN are brought in


KENT

Alack, why thus?


EDMUND

                  Yet Edmund was beloved:
The one the other poison'd for my sake,
And after slew herself.


ALBANY

Even so. Cover their faces.


EDMUND

I pant for life: some good I mean to do,
Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send,
Be brief in it, to the castle; for my writ
Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia:
Nay, send in time.


ALBANY

                  Run, run, O, run!


EDGAR

To who, my lord? Who hath the office? send
Thy token of reprieve.


EDMUND

Well thought on: take my sword,
Give it the captain.


ALBANY

Haste thee, for thy life.
Exit EDGAR


EDMUND

He hath commission from thy wife and me
To hang Cordelia in the prison, and
To lay the blame upon her own despair,
That she fordid herself.


ALBANY

The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.
EDMUND is borne off
Re-enter KING LEAR, with CORDELIA dead in his arms; EDGAR, Captain, and others following


KING LEAR

Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones:
Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so
That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!
I know when one is dead, and when one lives;
She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass;
If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,
Why, then she lives.


KENT

Is this the promised end


EDGAR

Or image of that horror?


ALBANY

Fall, and cease!


KING LEAR

This feather stirs; she lives! if it be so,
It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
That ever I have felt.


KENT

[Kneeling]  O my good master!


KING LEAR

Prithee, away.


EDGAR

'Tis noble Kent, your friend.


KING LEAR

A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!
I might have saved her; now she's gone for ever!
Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!
What is't thou say'st? Her voice was ever soft,
Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.
I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.


Captain

'Tis true, my lords, he did.


KING LEAR

Did I not, fellow?
I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion
I would have made them skip: I am old now,
And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?
Mine eyes are not o' the best: I'll tell you straight.


KENT

If fortune brag of two she loved and hated,
One of them we behold.


KING LEAR

This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?


KENT

The same,
Your servant Kent: Where is your servant Caius?


KING LEAR

He's a good fellow, I can tell you that;
He'll strike, and quickly too: he's dead and rotten.


KENT

No, my good lord; I am the very man,--


KING LEAR

I'll see that straight.


KENT

That, from your first of difference and decay,
Have follow'd your sad steps.


KING LEAR

You are welcome hither.


KENT

Nor no man else: all's cheerless, dark, and deadly.
Your eldest daughters have fordone them selves,
And desperately are dead.


KING LEAR

Ay, so I think.


ALBANY

He knows not what he says: and vain it is
That we present us to him.


EDGAR

Very bootless.
Enter a Captain


Captain

Edmund is dead, my lord.


ALBANY

That's but a trifle here.
You lords and noble friends, know our intent.
What comfort to this great decay may come
Shall be applied: for us we will resign,
During the life of this old majesty,
To him our absolute power:
To EDGAR and KENT
you, to your rights:
With boot, and such addition as your honours
Have more than merited. All friends shall taste
The wages of their virtue, and all foes
The cup of their deservings. O, see, see!


KING LEAR

And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!
Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,
And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,
Never, never, never, never, never!
Pray you, undo this button: thank you, sir.
Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,
Look there, look there!
Dies


EDGAR

He faints! My lord, my lord!


KENT

Break, heart; I prithee, break!


EDGAR

Look up, my lord.


KENT

Vex not his ghost: O, let him pass! he hates him much
That would upon the rack of this tough world
Stretch him out longer.


EDGAR

He is gone, indeed.


KENT

The wonder is, he hath endured so long:
He but usurp'd his life.


ALBANY

Bear them from hence. Our present business
Is general woe.
To KENT and EDGAR
Friends of my soul, you twain
Rule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.


KENT

I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;
My master calls me, I must not say no.


ALBANY

The weight of this sad time we must obey;
Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
The oldest hath borne most: we that are young
Shall never see so much, nor live so long.
Exeunt, with a dead march




Loves Labours Lost

ACT I
SCENE I. The king of Navarre's park.

Enter FERDINAND king of Navarre, BIRON, LONGAVILLE and DUMAIN


FERDINAND

Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,
Live register'd upon our brazen tombs
And then grace us in the disgrace of death;
When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,
The endeavor of this present breath may buy
That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge
And make us heirs of all eternity.
Therefore, brave conquerors,--for so you are,
That war against your own affections
And the huge army of the world's desires,--
Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:
Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;
Our court shall be a little Academe,
Still and contemplative in living art.
You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,
Have sworn for three years' term to live with me
My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes
That are recorded in this schedule here:
Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,
That his own hand may strike his honour down
That violates the smallest branch herein:
If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,
Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.


LONGAVILLE

I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:
The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:
Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits
Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.


DUMAIN

My loving lord, Dumain is mortified:
The grosser manner of these world's delights
He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:
To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;
With all these living in philosophy.


BIRON

I can but say their protestation over;
So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,
That is, to live and study here three years.
But there are other strict observances;
As, not to see a woman in that term,
Which I hope well is not enrolled there;
And one day in a week to touch no food
And but one meal on every day beside,
The which I hope is not enrolled there;
And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,
And not be seen to wink of all the day--
When I was wont to think no harm all night
And make a dark night too of half the day--
Which I hope well is not enrolled there:
O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!


FERDINAND

Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.


BIRON

Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:
I only swore to study with your grace
And stay here in your court for three years' space.


LONGAVILLE

You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.


BIRON

By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
What is the end of study? let me know.


FERDINAND

Why, that to know, which else we should not know.


BIRON

Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?


FERDINAND

Ay, that is study's godlike recompense.


BIRON

Come on, then; I will swear to study so,
To know the thing I am forbid to know:
As thus,--to study where I well may dine,
When I to feast expressly am forbid;
Or study where to meet some mistress fine,
When mistresses from common sense are hid;
Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,
Study to break it and not break my troth.
If study's gain be thus and this be so,
Study knows that which yet it doth not know:
Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.


FERDINAND

These be the stops that hinder study quite
And train our intellects to vain delight.


BIRON

Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain,
Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:
As, painfully to pore upon a book
To seek the light of truth; while truth the while
Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:
Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:
So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,
Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
Study me how to please the eye indeed
By fixing it upon a fairer eye,
Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed
And give him light that it was blinded by.
Study is like the heaven's glorious sun
That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:
Small have continual plodders ever won
Save base authority from others' books
These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
That give a name to every fixed star
Have no more profit of their shining nights
Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
Too much to know is to know nought but fame;
And every godfather can give a name.


FERDINAND

How well he's read, to reason against reading!


DUMAIN

Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!


LONGAVILLE

He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.


BIRON

The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.


DUMAIN

How follows that?


BIRON

                  Fit in his place and time.


DUMAIN

In reason nothing.


BIRON

                  Something then in rhyme.


FERDINAND

Biron is like an envious sneaping frost,
That bites the first-born infants of the spring.


BIRON

Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast
Before the birds have any cause to sing?
Why should I joy in any abortive birth?
At Christmas I no more desire a rose
Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;
But like of each thing that in season grows.
So you, to study now it is too late,
Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.


FERDINAND

Well, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu.


BIRON

No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:
And though I have for barbarism spoke more
Than for that angel knowledge you can say,
Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore
And bide the penance of each three years' day.
Give me the paper; let me read the same;
And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.


FERDINAND

How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!


BIRON

[Reads]  'Item, That no woman shall come within a
mile of my court:' Hath this been proclaimed?


LONGAVILLE

Four days ago.


BIRON

Let's see the penalty.
Reads
'On pain of losing her tongue.' Who devised this penalty?


LONGAVILLE

Marry, that did I.


BIRON

Sweet lord, and why?


LONGAVILLE

To fright them hence with that dread penalty.


BIRON

A dangerous law against gentility!
Reads
'Item, If any man be seen to talk with a woman
within the term of three years, he shall endure such
public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.'
This article, my liege, yourself must break;
For well you know here comes in embassy
The French king's daughter with yourself to speak--
A maid of grace and complete majesty--
About surrender up of Aquitaine
To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:
Therefore this article is made in vain,
Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.


FERDINAND

What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.


BIRON

So study evermore is overshot:
While it doth study to have what it would
It doth forget to do the thing it should,
And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,
'Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost.


FERDINAND

We must of force dispense with this decree;
She must lie here on mere necessity.


BIRON

Necessity will make us all forsworn
Three thousand times within this three years' space;
For every man with his affects is born,
Not by might master'd but by special grace:
If I break faith, this word shall speak for me;
I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'
So to the laws at large I write my name:
Subscribes
And he that breaks them in the least degree
Stands in attainder of eternal shame:
Suggestions are to other as to me;
But I believe, although I seem so loath,
I am the last that will last keep his oath.
But is there no quick recreation granted?


FERDINAND

Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted
With a refined traveller of Spain;
A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;
One whom the music of his own vain tongue
Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;
A man of complements, whom right and wrong
Have chose as umpire of their mutiny:
This child of fancy, that Armado hight,
For interim to our studies shall relate
In high-born words the worth of many a knight
From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.
How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;
But, I protest, I love to hear him lie
And I will use him for my minstrelsy.


BIRON

Armado is a most illustrious wight,
A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.


LONGAVILLE

Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;
And so to study, three years is but short.
Enter DULL with a letter, and COSTARD


DULL

Which is the duke's own person?


BIRON

This, fellow: what wouldst?


DULL

I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his
grace's tharborough: but I would see his own person
in flesh and blood.


BIRON

This is he.


DULL

Signior Arme--Arme--commends you. There's villany
abroad: this letter will tell you more.


COSTARD

Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.


FERDINAND

A letter from the magnificent Armado.


BIRON

How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.


LONGAVILLE

A high hope for a low heaven: God grant us patience!


BIRON

To hear? or forbear laughing?


LONGAVILLE

To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or to
forbear both.


BIRON

Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to
climb in the merriness.


COSTARD

The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.
The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.


BIRON

In what manner?


COSTARD

In manner and form following, sir; all those three:
I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with
her upon the form, and taken following her into the
park; which, put together, is in manner and form
following. Now, sir, for the manner,--it is the
manner of a man to speak to a woman: for the form,--
in some form.


BIRON

For the following, sir?


COSTARD

As it shall follow in my correction: and God defend
the right!


FERDINAND

Will you hear this letter with attention?


BIRON

As we would hear an oracle.


COSTARD

Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.


FERDINAND

[Reads]  'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and
sole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god,
and body's fostering patron.'


COSTARD

Not a word of Costard yet.


FERDINAND

[Reads]  'So it is,'--


COSTARD

It may be so: but if he say it is so, he is, in
telling true, but so.


FERDINAND

Peace!


COSTARD

Be to me and every man that dares not fight!


FERDINAND

No words!


COSTARD

Of other men's secrets, I beseech you.


FERDINAND

[Reads]  'So it is, besieged with sable-coloured
melancholy, I did commend the black-oppressing humour
to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving
air; and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself to
walk. The time when. About the sixth hour; when
beasts most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down
to that nourishment which is called supper: so much
for the time when. Now for the ground which; which,
I mean, I walked upon: it is y-cleped thy park. Then
for the place where; where, I mean, I did encounter
that obscene and preposterous event, that draweth
from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink, which
here thou viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or seest;
but to the place where; it standeth north-north-east
and by east from the west corner of thy curious-
knotted garden: there did I see that low-spirited
swain, that base minnow of thy mirth,'--


COSTARD

Me?


FERDINAND

[Reads]  'that unlettered small-knowing soul,'--


COSTARD

Me?


FERDINAND

[Reads]  'that shallow vassal,'--


COSTARD

Still me?


FERDINAND

[Reads]  'which, as I remember, hight Costard,'--


COSTARD

O, me!


FERDINAND

[Reads]  'sorted and consorted, contrary to thy
established proclaimed edict and continent canon,
which with,--O, with--but with this I passion to say
wherewith,--


COSTARD

With a wench.


FERDINAND

[Reads]  'with a child of our grandmother Eve, a
female; or, for thy more sweet understanding, a
woman. Him I, as my ever-esteemed duty pricks me on,
have sent to thee, to receive the meed of
punishment, by thy sweet grace's officer, Anthony
Dull; a man of good repute, carriage, bearing, and
estimation.'


DULL

'Me, an't shall please you; I am Anthony Dull.


FERDINAND

[Reads]  'For Jaquenetta,--so is the weaker vessel
called which I apprehended with the aforesaid
swain,--I keep her as a vessel of the law's fury;
and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice, bring
her to trial. Thine, in all compliments of devoted
and heart-burning heat of duty.
DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'


BIRON

This is not so well as I looked for, but the best
that ever I heard.


FERDINAND

Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say
you to this?


COSTARD

Sir, I confess the wench.


FERDINAND

Did you hear the proclamation?


COSTARD

I do confess much of the hearing it but little of
the marking of it.


FERDINAND

It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment, to be taken
with a wench.


COSTARD

I was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a damsel.


FERDINAND

Well, it was proclaimed 'damsel.'


COSTARD

This was no damsel, neither, sir; she was a virgin.


FERDINAND

It is so varied, too; for it was proclaimed 'virgin.'


COSTARD

If it were, I deny her virginity: I was taken with a maid.


FERDINAND

This maid will not serve your turn, sir.


COSTARD

This maid will serve my turn, sir.


FERDINAND

Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast
a week with bran and water.


COSTARD

I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.


FERDINAND

And Don Armado shall be your keeper.
My Lord Biron, see him deliver'd o'er:
And go we, lords, to put in practise that
Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.
Exeunt FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN


BIRON

I'll lay my head to any good man's hat,
These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.
Sirrah, come on.


COSTARD

I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is, I was
taken with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true
girl; and therefore welcome the sour cup of
prosperity! Affliction may one day smile again; and
till then, sit thee down, sorrow!
Exeunt
LOVE'S LABOURS LOST

SCENE II. The same.

Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH


DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit
grows melancholy?


MOTH

A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.


MOTH

No, no; O Lord, sir, no.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my
tender juvenal?


MOTH

By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough senior.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Why tough senior? why tough senior?


MOTH

Why tender juvenal? why tender juvenal?
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton
appertaining to thy young days, which we may
nominate tender.


MOTH

And I, tough senior, as an appertinent title to your
old time, which we may name tough.
DON ADRIANO DE


ARMADO

Pretty and apt.


MOTH

How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? or
I apt, and my saying pretty?
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Thou pretty, because little.


MOTH

Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

And therefore apt, because quick.


MOTH

Speak you this in my praise, master?
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

In thy condign praise.


MOTH

I will praise an eel with the same praise.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

What, that an eel is ingenious?


MOTH

That an eel is quick.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

I do say thou art quick in answers: thou heatest my blood.


MOTH

I am answered, sir.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

I love not to be crossed.


MOTH

[Aside]  He speaks the mere contrary; crosses love not him.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

I have promised to study three years with the duke.


MOTH

You may do it in an hour, sir.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Impossible.


MOTH

How many is one thrice told?
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

I am ill at reckoning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.


MOTH

You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

I confess both: they are both the varnish of a
complete man.


MOTH

Then, I am sure, you know how much the gross sum of
deuce-ace amounts to.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

It doth amount to one more than two.


MOTH

Which the base vulgar do call three.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

True.


MOTH

Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here
is three studied, ere ye'll thrice wink: and how
easy it is to put 'years' to the word 'three,' and
study three years in two words, the dancing horse
will tell you.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

A most fine figure!


MOTH

To prove you a cipher.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

I will hereupon confess I am in love: and as it is
base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a
base wench. If drawing my sword against the humour
of affection would deliver me from the reprobate
thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and
ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised
courtesy. I think scorn to sigh: methinks I should
outswear Cupid. Comfort, me, boy: what great men
have been in love?


MOTH

Hercules, master.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name
more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good
repute and carriage.


MOTH

Samson, master: he was a man of good carriage, great
carriage, for he carried the town-gates on his back
like a porter: and he was in love.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do
excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in
carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson's
love, my dear Moth?


MOTH

A woman, master.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Of what complexion?


MOTH

Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Tell me precisely of what complexion.


MOTH

Of the sea-water green, sir.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Is that one of the four complexions?


MOTH

As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Green indeed is the colour of lovers; but to have a
love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason
for it. He surely affected her for her wit.


MOTH

It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

My love is most immaculate white and red.


MOTH

Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked under
such colours.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Define, define, well-educated infant.


MOTH

My father's wit and my mother's tongue, assist me!
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty and
pathetical!


MOTH

     If she be made of white and red,
Her faults will ne'er be known,
For blushing cheeks by faults are bred
And fears by pale white shown:
Then if she fear, or be to blame,
By this you shall not know,
For still her cheeks possess the same
Which native she doth owe.
A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of
white and red.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?


MOTH

The world was very guilty of such a ballad some
three ages since: but I think now 'tis not to be
found; or, if it were, it would neither serve for
the writing nor the tune.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may
example my digression by some mighty precedent.
Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in the
park with the rational hind Costard: she deserves well.


MOTH

[Aside]  To be whipped; and yet a better love than
my master.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.


MOTH

And that's great marvel, loving a light wench.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

I say, sing.


MOTH

Forbear till this company be past.
Enter DULL, COSTARD, and JAQUENETTA


DULL

Sir, the duke's pleasure is, that you keep Costard
safe: and you must suffer him to take no delight
nor no penance; but a' must fast three days a week.
For this damsel, I must keep her at the park: she
is allowed for the day-woman. Fare you well.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!


JAQUENETTA

Man?
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

I will visit thee at the lodge.


JAQUENETTA

That's hereby.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

I know where it is situate.


JAQUENETTA

Lord, how wise you are!
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

I will tell thee wonders.


JAQUENETTA

With that face?
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

I love thee.


JAQUENETTA

So I heard you say.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

And so, farewell.


JAQUENETTA

Fair weather after you!


DULL

Come, Jaquenetta, away!
Exeunt DULL and JAQUENETTA
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou
be pardoned.


COSTARD

Well, sir, I hope, when I do it, I shall do it on a
full stomach.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Thou shalt be heavily punished.


COSTARD

I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they
are but lightly rewarded.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Take away this villain; shut him up.


MOTH

Come, you transgressing slave; away!


COSTARD

Let me not be pent up, sir: I will fast, being loose.


MOTH

No, sir; that were fast and loose: thou shalt to prison.


COSTARD

Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation
that I have seen, some shall see.


MOTH

What shall some see?


COSTARD

Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon.
It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their
words; and therefore I will say nothing: I thank
God I have as little patience as another man; and
therefore I can be quiet.
Exeunt MOTH and COSTARD
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

I do affect the very ground, which is base, where
her shoe, which is baser, guided by her foot, which
is basest, doth tread. I shall be forsworn, which
is a great argument of falsehood, if I love. And
how can that be true love which is falsely
attempted? Love is a familiar; Love is a devil:
there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so
tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was
Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.
Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club;
and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier.
The first and second cause will not serve my turn;
the passado he respects not, the duello he regards
not: his disgrace is to be called boy; but his
glory is to subdue men. Adieu, valour! rust rapier!
be still, drum! for your manager is in love; yea,
he loveth. Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme,
for I am sure I shall turn sonnet. Devise, wit;
write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio.
Exit
LOVE'S LABOURS LOST

ACT II
SCENE I. The same.

Enter the PRINCESS of France, ROSALINE, MARIA, KATHARINE, BOYET, Lords, and other Attendants


BOYET

Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits:
Consider who the king your father sends,
To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:
Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,
To parley with the sole inheritor
Of all perfections that a man may owe,
Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight
Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.
Be now as prodigal of all dear grace
As Nature was in making graces dear
When she did starve the general world beside
And prodigally gave them all to you.


PRINCESS

Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,
Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:
Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,
Not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues:
I am less proud to hear you tell my worth
Than you much willing to be counted wise
In spending your wit in the praise of mine.
But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,
You are not ignorant, all-telling fame
Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,
Till painful study shall outwear three years,
No woman may approach his silent court:
Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,
Before we enter his forbidden gates,
To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,
Bold of your worthiness, we single you
As our best-moving fair solicitor.
Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,
On serious business, craving quick dispatch,
Importunes personal conference with his grace:
Haste, signify so much; while we attend,
Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will.


BOYET

Proud of employment, willingly I go.


PRINCESS

All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.
Exit BOYET
Who are the votaries, my loving lords,
That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke?


First Lord

Lord Longaville is one.


PRINCESS

Know you the man?


MARIA

I know him, madam: at a marriage-feast,
Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir
Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized
In Normandy, saw I this Longaville:
A man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd;
Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms:
Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.
The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,
Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will;
Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills
It should none spare that come within his power.


PRINCESS

Some merry mocking lord, belike; is't so?


MARIA

They say so most that most his humours know.


PRINCESS

Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow.
Who are the rest?


KATHARINE

The young Dumain, a well-accomplished youth,
Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:
Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill;
For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,
And shape to win grace though he had no wit.
I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once;
And much too little of that good I saw
Is my report to his great worthiness.


ROSALINE

Another of these students at that time
Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.
Biron they call him; but a merrier man,
Within the limit of becoming mirth,
I never spent an hour's talk withal:
His eye begets occasion for his wit;
For every object that the one doth catch
The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,
Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,
Delivers in such apt and gracious words
That aged ears play truant at his tales
And younger hearings are quite ravished;
So sweet and voluble is his discourse.


PRINCESS

God bless my ladies! are they all in love,
That every one her own hath garnished
With such bedecking ornaments of praise?


First Lord

Here comes Boyet.
Re-enter BOYET


PRINCESS

Now, what admittance, lord?


BOYET

Navarre had notice of your fair approach;
And he and his competitors in oath
Were all address'd to meet you, gentle lady,
Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:
He rather means to lodge you in the field,
Like one that comes here to besiege his court,
Than seek a dispensation for his oath,
To let you enter his unpeopled house.
Here comes Navarre.
Enter FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, DUMAIN, BIRON, and Attendants


FERDINAND

Fair princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.


PRINCESS

'Fair' I give you back again; and 'welcome' I have
not yet: the roof of this court is too high to be
yours; and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.


FERDINAND

You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.


PRINCESS

I will be welcome, then: conduct me thither.


FERDINAND

Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.


PRINCESS

Our Lady help my lord! he'll be forsworn.


FERDINAND

Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.


PRINCESS

Why, will shall break it; will and nothing else.


FERDINAND

Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.


PRINCESS

Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,
Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.
I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping:
Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,
And sin to break it.
But pardon me. I am too sudden-bold:
To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.
Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,
And suddenly resolve me in my suit.


FERDINAND

Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.


PRINCESS

You will the sooner, that I were away;
For you'll prove perjured if you make me stay.


BIRON

Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?


ROSALINE

Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?


BIRON

I know you did.


ROSALINE

How needless was it then to ask the question!


BIRON

You must not be so quick.


ROSALINE

'Tis 'long of you that spur me with such questions.


BIRON

Your wit's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.


ROSALINE

Not till it leave the rider in the mire.


BIRON

What time o' day?


ROSALINE

The hour that fools should ask.


BIRON

Now fair befall your mask!


ROSALINE

Fair fall the face it covers!


BIRON

And send you many lovers!


ROSALINE

Amen, so you be none.


BIRON

Nay, then will I be gone.


FERDINAND

Madam, your father here doth intimate
The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;
Being but the one half of an entire sum
Disbursed by my father in his wars.
But say that he or we, as neither have,
Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which,
One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,
Although not valued to the money's worth.
If then the king your father will restore
But that one half which is unsatisfied,
We will give up our right in Aquitaine,
And hold fair friendship with his majesty.
But that, it seems, he little purposeth,
For here he doth demand to have repaid
A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
To have his title live in Aquitaine;
Which we much rather had depart withal
And have the money by our father lent
Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.
Dear Princess, were not his requests so far
From reason's yielding, your fair self should make
A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast
And go well satisfied to France again.


PRINCESS

You do the king my father too much wrong
And wrong the reputation of your name,
In so unseeming to confess receipt
Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.


FERDINAND

I do protest I never heard of it;
And if you prove it, I'll repay it back
Or yield up Aquitaine.


PRINCESS

We arrest your word.
Boyet, you can produce acquittances
For such a sum from special officers
Of Charles his father.


FERDINAND

Satisfy me so.


BOYET

So please your grace, the packet is not come
Where that and other specialties are bound:
To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.


FERDINAND

It shall suffice me: at which interview
All liberal reason I will yield unto.
Meantime receive such welcome at my hand
As honour without breach of honour may
Make tender of to thy true worthiness:
You may not come, fair princess, in my gates;
But here without you shall be so received
As you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,
Though so denied fair harbour in my house.
Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell:
To-morrow shall we visit you again.


PRINCESS

Sweet health and fair desires consort your grace!


FERDINAND

Thy own wish wish I thee in every place!
Exit


BIRON

Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart.


ROSALINE

Pray you, do my commendations; I would be glad to see it.


BIRON

I would you heard it groan.


ROSALINE

Is the fool sick?


BIRON

Sick at the heart.


ROSALINE

Alack, let it blood.


BIRON

Would that do it good?


ROSALINE

My physic says 'ay.'


BIRON

Will you prick't with your eye?


ROSALINE

No point, with my knife.


BIRON

Now, God save thy life!


ROSALINE

And yours from long living!


BIRON

I cannot stay thanksgiving.
Retiring


DUMAIN

Sir, I pray you, a word: what lady is that same?


BOYET

The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.


DUMAIN

A gallant lady. Monsieur, fare you well.
Exit


LONGAVILLE

I beseech you a word: what is she in the white?


BOYET

A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.


LONGAVILLE

Perchance light in the light. I desire her name.


BOYET

She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a shame.


LONGAVILLE

Pray you, sir, whose daughter?


BOYET

Her mother's, I have heard.


LONGAVILLE

God's blessing on your beard!


BOYET

Good sir, be not offended.
She is an heir of Falconbridge.


LONGAVILLE

Nay, my choler is ended.
She is a most sweet lady.


BOYET

Not unlike, sir, that may be.
Exit LONGAVILLE


BIRON

What's her name in the cap?


BOYET

Rosaline, by good hap.


BIRON

Is she wedded or no?


BOYET

To her will, sir, or so.


BIRON

You are welcome, sir: adieu.


BOYET

Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.
Exit BIRON


MARIA

That last is Biron, the merry madcap lord:
Not a word with him but a jest.


BOYET

And every jest but a word.


PRINCESS

It was well done of you to take him at his word.


BOYET

I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.


MARIA

Two hot sheeps, marry.


BOYET

And wherefore not ships?
No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.


MARIA

You sheep, and I pasture: shall that finish the jest?


BOYET

So you grant pasture for me.
Offering to kiss her


MARIA

Not so, gentle beast:
My lips are no common, though several they be.


BOYET

Belonging to whom?


MARIA

                  To my fortunes and me.


PRINCESS

Good wits will be jangling; but, gentles, agree:
This civil war of wits were much better used
On Navarre and his book-men; for here 'tis abused.


BOYET

If my observation, which very seldom lies,
By the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes,
Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.


PRINCESS

With what?


BOYET

With that which we lovers entitle affected.


PRINCESS

Your reason?


BOYET

Why, all his behaviors did make their retire
To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire:
His heart, like an agate, with your print impress'd,
Proud with his form, in his eye pride express'd:
His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,
Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;
All senses to that sense did make their repair,
To feel only looking on fairest of fair:
Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,
As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;
Who, tendering their own worth from where they were glass'd,
Did point you to buy them, along as you pass'd:
His face's own margent did quote such amazes
That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.
I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,
An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.


PRINCESS

Come to our pavilion: Boyet is disposed.


BOYET

But to speak that in words which his eye hath
disclosed.
I only have made a mouth of his eye,
By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.


ROSALINE

Thou art an old love-monger and speakest skilfully.


MARIA

He is Cupid's grandfather and learns news of him.


ROSALINE

Then was Venus like her mother, for her father is but grim.


BOYET

Do you hear, my mad wenches?


MARIA

No.


BOYET

What then, do you see?


ROSALINE

Ay, our way to be gone.


BOYET

You are too hard for me.
Exeunt
LOVE'S LABOURS LOST

ACT III
SCENE I. The same.

Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH


DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.


MOTH

Concolinel.
Singing
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years; take this key,
give enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately
hither: I must employ him in a letter to my love.


MOTH

Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

How meanest thou? brawling in French?


MOTH

No, my complete master: but to jig off a tune at
the tongue's end, canary to it with your feet, humour
it with turning up your eyelids, sigh a note and
sing a note, sometime through the throat, as if you
swallowed love with singing love, sometime through
the nose, as if you snuffed up love by smelling
love; with your hat penthouse-like o'er the shop of
your eyes; with your arms crossed on your thin-belly
doublet like a rabbit on a spit; or your hands in
your pocket like a man after the old painting; and
keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away.
These are complements, these are humours; these
betray nice wenches, that would be betrayed without
these; and make them men of note--do you note
me?--that most are affected to these.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

How hast thou purchased this experience?


MOTH

By my penny of observation.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

But O,--but O,--


MOTH

'The hobby-horse is forgot.'
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Callest thou my love 'hobby-horse'?


MOTH

No, master; the hobby-horse is but a colt, and your
love perhaps a hackney. But have you forgot your love?
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Almost I had.


MOTH

Negligent student! learn her by heart.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

By heart and in heart, boy.


MOTH

And out of heart, master: all those three I will prove.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

What wilt thou prove?


MOTH

A man, if I live; and this, by, in, and without, upon
the instant: by heart you love her, because your
heart cannot come by her; in heart you love her,
because your heart is in love with her; and out of
heart you love her, being out of heart that you
cannot enjoy her.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

I am all these three.


MOTH

And three times as much more, and yet nothing at
all.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Fetch hither the swain: he must carry me a letter.


MOTH

A message well sympathized; a horse to be ambassador
for an ass.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Ha, ha! what sayest thou?


MOTH

Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse,
for he is very slow-gaited. But I go.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

The way is but short: away!


MOTH

As swift as lead, sir.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

The meaning, pretty ingenious?
Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?


MOTH

Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

I say lead is slow.


MOTH

You are too swift, sir, to say so:
Is that lead slow which is fired from a gun?
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
He reputes me a cannon; and the bullet, that's he:
I shoot thee at the swain.


MOTH

Thump then and I flee.
Exit
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

A most acute juvenal; voluble and free of grace!
By thy favour, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face:
Most rude melancholy, valour gives thee place.
My herald is return'd.
Re-enter MOTH with COSTARD


MOTH

A wonder, master! here's a costard broken in a shin.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Some enigma, some riddle: come, thy l'envoy; begin.


COSTARD

No enigma, no riddle, no l'envoy; no salve in the
mail, sir: O, sir, plantain, a plain plantain! no
l'envoy, no l'envoy; no salve, sir, but a plantain!
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

By virtue, thou enforcest laughter; thy silly
thought my spleen; the heaving of my lungs provokes
me to ridiculous smiling. O, pardon me, my stars!
Doth the inconsiderate take salve for l'envoy, and
the word l'envoy for a salve?


MOTH

Do the wise think them other? is not l'envoy a salve?
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

No, page: it is an epilogue or discourse, to make plain
Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.
I will example it:
The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
Were still at odds, being but three.
There's the moral. Now the l'envoy.


MOTH

I will add the l'envoy. Say the moral again.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

          The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
Were still at odds, being but three.


MOTH

          Until the goose came out of door,
And stay'd the odds by adding four.
Now will I begin your moral, and do you follow with
my l'envoy.
The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
Were still at odds, being but three.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

          Until the goose came out of door,
Staying the odds by adding four.


MOTH

A good l'envoy, ending in the goose: would you
desire more?


COSTARD

The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that's flat.
Sir, your pennyworth is good, an your goose be fat.
To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose:
Let me see; a fat l'envoy; ay, that's a fat goose.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?


MOTH

By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
Then call'd you for the l'envoy.


COSTARD

True, and I for a plantain: thus came your
argument in;
Then the boy's fat l'envoy, the goose that you bought;
And he ended the market.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

But tell me; how was there a costard broken in a shin?


MOTH

I will tell you sensibly.


COSTARD

Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth: I will speak that l'envoy:
I Costard, running out, that was safely within,
Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

We will talk no more of this matter.


COSTARD

Till there be more matter in the shin.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Sirrah Costard, I will enfranchise thee.


COSTARD

O, marry me to one Frances: I smell some l'envoy,
some goose, in this.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,
enfreedoming thy person; thou wert immured,
restrained, captivated, bound.


COSTARD

True, true; and now you will be my purgation and let me loose.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance; and,
in lieu thereof, impose on thee nothing but this:
bear this significant
Giving a letter
to the country maid Jaquenetta:
there is remuneration; for the best ward of mine
honour is rewarding my dependents. Moth, follow.
Exit


MOTH

Like the sequel, I. Signior Costard, adieu.


COSTARD

My sweet ounce of man's flesh! my incony Jew!
Exit MOTH
Now will I look to his remuneration. Remuneration!
O, that's the Latin word for three farthings: three
farthings--remuneration.--'What's the price of this
inkle?'--'One penny.'--'No, I'll give you a
remuneration:' why, it carries it. Remuneration!
why, it is a fairer name than French crown. I will
never buy and sell out of this word.
Enter BIRON


BIRON

O, my good knave Costard! exceedingly well met.


COSTARD

Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man
buy for a remuneration?


BIRON

What is a remuneration?


COSTARD

Marry, sir, halfpenny farthing.


BIRON

Why, then, three-farthing worth of silk.


COSTARD

I thank your worship: God be wi' you!


BIRON

Stay, slave; I must employ thee:
As thou wilt win my favour, good my knave,
Do one thing for me that I shall entreat.


COSTARD

When would you have it done, sir?


BIRON

This afternoon.


COSTARD

Well, I will do it, sir: fare you well.


BIRON

Thou knowest not what it is.


COSTARD

I shall know, sir, when I have done it.


BIRON

Why, villain, thou must know first.


COSTARD

I will come to your worship to-morrow morning.


BIRON

It must be done this afternoon.
Hark, slave, it is but this:
The princess comes to hunt here in the park,
And in her train there is a gentle lady;
When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name,
And Rosaline they call her: ask for her;
And to her white hand see thou do commend
This seal'd-up counsel. There's thy guerdon; go.
Giving him a shilling


COSTARD

Gardon, O sweet gardon! better than remuneration,
a'leven-pence farthing better: most sweet gardon! I
will do it sir, in print. Gardon! Remuneration!
Exit


BIRON

And I, forsooth, in love! I, that have been love's whip;
A very beadle to a humorous sigh;
A critic, nay, a night-watch constable;
A domineering pedant o'er the boy;
Than whom no mortal so magnificent!
This whimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy;
This senior-junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid;
Regent of love-rhymes, lord of folded arms,
The anointed sovereign of sighs and groans,
Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,
Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces,
Sole imperator and great general
Of trotting 'paritors:--O my little heart:--
And I to be a corporal of his field,
And wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop!
What, I! I love! I sue! I seek a wife!
A woman, that is like a German clock,
Still a-repairing, ever out of frame,
And never going aright, being a watch,
But being watch'd that it may still go right!
Nay, to be perjured, which is worst of all;
And, among three, to love the worst of all;
A wightly wanton with a velvet brow,
With two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes;
Ay, and by heaven, one that will do the deed
Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard:
And I to sigh for her! to watch for her!
To pray for her! Go to; it is a plague
That Cupid will impose for my neglect
Of his almighty dreadful little might.
Well, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue and groan:
Some men must love my lady and some Joan.
Exit
LOVE'S LABOURS LOST

ACT IV
SCENE I. The same.

Enter the PRINCESS, and her train, a Forester, BOYET, ROSALINE, MARIA, and KATHARINE


PRINCESS

Was that the king, that spurred his horse so hard
Against the steep uprising of the hill?


BOYET

I know not; but I think it was not he.


PRINCESS

Whoe'er a' was, a' show'd a mounting mind.
Well, lords, to-day we shall have our dispatch:
On Saturday we will return to France.
Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush
That we must stand and play the murderer in?


Forester

Hereby, upon the edge of yonder coppice;
A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.


PRINCESS

I thank my beauty, I am fair that shoot,
And thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot.


Forester

Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so.


PRINCESS

What, what? first praise me and again say no?
O short-lived pride! Not fair? alack for woe!


Forester

Yes, madam, fair.


PRINCESS

                  Nay, never paint me now:
Where fair is not, praise cannot mend the brow.
Here, good my glass, take this for telling true:
Fair payment for foul words is more than due.


Forester

Nothing but fair is that which you inherit.


PRINCESS

See see, my beauty will be saved by merit!
O heresy in fair, fit for these days!
A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.
But come, the bow: now mercy goes to kill,
And shooting well is then accounted ill.
Thus will I save my credit in the shoot:
Not wounding, pity would not let me do't;
If wounding, then it was to show my skill,
That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.
And out of question so it is sometimes,
Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,
When, for fame's sake, for praise, an outward part,
We bend to that the working of the heart;
As I for praise alone now seek to spill
The poor deer's blood, that my heart means no ill.


BOYET

Do not curst wives hold that self-sovereignty
Only for praise sake, when they strive to be
Lords o'er their lords?


PRINCESS

Only for praise: and praise we may afford
To any lady that subdues a lord.


BOYET

Here comes a member of the commonwealth.
Enter COSTARD


COSTARD

God dig-you-den all! Pray you, which is the head lady?


PRINCESS

Thou shalt know her, fellow, by the rest that have no heads.


COSTARD

Which is the greatest lady, the highest?


PRINCESS

The thickest and the tallest.


COSTARD

The thickest and the tallest! it is so; truth is truth.
An your waist, mistress, were as slender as my wit,
One o' these maids' girdles for your waist should be fit.
Are not you the chief woman? you are the thickest here.


PRINCESS

What's your will, sir? what's your will?


COSTARD

I have a letter from Monsieur Biron to one Lady Rosaline.


PRINCESS

O, thy letter, thy letter! he's a good friend of mine:
Stand aside, good bearer. Boyet, you can carve;
Break up this capon.


BOYET

I am bound to serve.
This letter is mistook, it importeth none here;
It is writ to Jaquenetta.


PRINCESS

We will read it, I swear.
Break the neck of the wax, and every one give ear.
Reads


BOYET

'By heaven, that thou art fair, is most infallible;
true, that thou art beauteous; truth itself, that
thou art lovely. More fairer than fair, beautiful
than beauteous, truer than truth itself, have
commiseration on thy heroical vassal! The
magnanimous and most illustrate king Cophetua set
eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar
Zenelophon; and he it was that might rightly say,
Veni, vidi, vici; which to annothanize in the
vulgar,--O base and obscure vulgar!--videlicet, He
came, saw, and overcame: he came, one; saw two;
overcame, three. Who came? the king: why did he
come? to see: why did he see? to overcome: to
whom came he? to the beggar: what saw he? the
beggar: who overcame he? the beggar. The
conclusion is victory: on whose side? the king's.
The captive is enriched: on whose side? the
beggar's. The catastrophe is a nuptial: on whose
side? the king's: no, on both in one, or one in
both. I am the king; for so stands the comparison:
thou the beggar; for so witnesseth thy lowliness.
Shall I command thy love? I may: shall I enforce
thy love? I could: shall I entreat thy love? I
will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? robes;
for tittles? titles; for thyself? me. Thus,
expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy foot,
my eyes on thy picture. and my heart on thy every
part. Thine, in the dearest design of industry,
DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'
Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
'Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey.
Submissive fall his princely feet before,
And he from forage will incline to play:
But if thou strive, poor soul, what art thou then?
Food for his rage, repasture for his den.


PRINCESS

What plume of feathers is he that indited this letter?
What vane? what weathercock? did you ever hear better?


BOYET

I am much deceived but I remember the style.


PRINCESS

Else your memory is bad, going o'er it erewhile.


BOYET

This Armado is a Spaniard, that keeps here in court;
A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport
To the prince and his bookmates.


PRINCESS

Thou fellow, a word:
Who gave thee this letter?


COSTARD

I told you; my lord.


PRINCESS

To whom shouldst thou give it?


COSTARD

From my lord to my lady.


PRINCESS

From which lord to which lady?


COSTARD

From my lord Biron, a good master of mine,
To a lady of France that he call'd Rosaline.


PRINCESS

Thou hast mistaken his letter. Come, lords, away.
To ROSALINE
Here, sweet, put up this: 'twill be thine another day.
Exeunt PRINCESS and train


BOYET

Who is the suitor? who is the suitor?


ROSALINE

Shall I teach you to know?


BOYET

Ay, my continent of beauty.


ROSALINE

Why, she that bears the bow.
Finely put off!


BOYET

My lady goes to kill horns; but, if thou marry,
Hang me by the neck, if horns that year miscarry.
Finely put on!


ROSALINE

Well, then, I am the shooter.


BOYET

And who is your deer?


ROSALINE

If we choose by the horns, yourself come not near.
Finely put on, indeed!


MARIA

You still wrangle with her, Boyet, and she strikes
at the brow.


BOYET

But she herself is hit lower: have I hit her now?


ROSALINE

Shall I come upon thee with an old saying, that was
a man when King Pepin of France was a little boy, as
touching the hit it?


BOYET

So I may answer thee with one as old, that was a
woman when Queen Guinover of Britain was a little
wench, as touching the hit it.


ROSALINE

          Thou canst not hit it, hit it, hit it,
Thou canst not hit it, my good man.


BOYET

          An I cannot, cannot, cannot,
An I cannot, another can.
Exeunt ROSALINE and KATHARINE


COSTARD

By my troth, most pleasant: how both did fit it!


MARIA

A mark marvellous well shot, for they both did hit it.


BOYET

A mark! O, mark but that mark! A mark, says my lady!
Let the mark have a prick in't, to mete at, if it may be.


MARIA

Wide o' the bow hand! i' faith, your hand is out.


COSTARD

Indeed, a' must shoot nearer, or he'll ne'er hit the clout.


BOYET

An if my hand be out, then belike your hand is in.


COSTARD

Then will she get the upshoot by cleaving the pin.


MARIA

Come, come, you talk greasily; your lips grow foul.


COSTARD

She's too hard for you at pricks, sir: challenge her to bowl.


BOYET

I fear too much rubbing. Good night, my good owl.
Exeunt BOYET and MARIA


COSTARD

By my soul, a swain! a most simple clown!
Lord, Lord, how the ladies and I have put him down!
O' my troth, most sweet jests! most incony
vulgar wit!
When it comes so smoothly off, so obscenely, as it
were, so fit.
Armado o' th' one side,--O, a most dainty man!
To see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan!
To see him kiss his hand! and how most sweetly a'
will swear!
And his page o' t' other side, that handful of wit!
Ah, heavens, it is a most pathetical nit!
Sola, sola!
Shout within
Exit COSTARD, running
LOVE'S LABOURS LOST

SCENE II. The same.

Enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, and DULL


SIR NATHANIEL

Very reverend sport, truly; and done in the testimony
of a good conscience.


HOLOFERNES

The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood; ripe
as the pomewater, who now hangeth like a jewel in
the ear of caelo, the sky, the welkin, the heaven;
and anon falleth like a crab on the face of terra,
the soil, the land, the earth.


SIR NATHANIEL

Truly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are sweetly
varied, like a scholar at the least: but, sir, I
assure ye, it was a buck of the first head.


HOLOFERNES

Sir Nathaniel, haud credo.


DULL

'Twas not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.


HOLOFERNES

Most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of
insinuation, as it were, in via, in way, of
explication; facere, as it were, replication, or
rather, ostentare, to show, as it were, his
inclination, after his undressed, unpolished,
uneducated, unpruned, untrained, or rather,
unlettered, or ratherest, unconfirmed fashion, to
insert again my haud credo for a deer.


DULL

I said the deer was not a haud credo; twas a pricket.


HOLOFERNES

Twice-sod simplicity, his coctus!
O thou monster Ignorance, how deformed dost thou look!


SIR NATHANIEL

Sir, he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred
in a book; he hath not eat paper, as it were; he
hath not drunk ink: his intellect is not
replenished; he is only an animal, only sensible in
the duller parts:
And such barren plants are set before us, that we
thankful should be,
Which we of taste and feeling are, for those parts that
do fructify in us more than he.
For as it would ill become me to be vain, indiscreet, or a fool,
So were there a patch set on learning, to see him in a school:
But omne bene, say I; being of an old father's mind,
Many can brook the weather that love not the wind.


DULL

You two are book-men: can you tell me by your wit
What was a month old at Cain's birth, that's not five
weeks old as yet?


HOLOFERNES

Dictynna, goodman Dull; Dictynna, goodman Dull.


DULL

What is Dictynna?


SIR NATHANIEL

A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.


HOLOFERNES

The moon was a month old when Adam was no more,
And raught not to five weeks when he came to
five-score.
The allusion holds in the exchange.


DULL

'Tis true indeed; the collusion holds in the exchange.


HOLOFERNES

God comfort thy capacity! I say, the allusion holds
in the exchange.


DULL

And I say, the pollusion holds in the exchange; for
the moon is never but a month old: and I say beside
that, 'twas a pricket that the princess killed.


HOLOFERNES

Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph
on the death of the deer? And, to humour the
ignorant, call I the deer the princess killed a pricket.


SIR NATHANIEL

Perge, good Master Holofernes, perge; so it shall
please you to abrogate scurrility.


HOLOFERNES

I will something affect the letter, for it argues facility.
The preyful princess pierced and prick'd a pretty
pleasing pricket;
Some say a sore; but not a sore, till now made
sore with shooting.
The dogs did yell: put L to sore, then sorel jumps
from thicket;
Or pricket sore, or else sorel; the people fall a-hooting.
If sore be sore, then L to sore makes fifty sores
one sorel.
Of one sore I an hundred make by adding but one more L.


SIR NATHANIEL

A rare talent!


DULL

[Aside]  If a talent be a claw, look how he claws
him with a talent.


HOLOFERNES

This is a gift that I have, simple, simple; a
foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures,
shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions,
revolutions: these are begot in the ventricle of
memory, nourished in the womb of pia mater, and
delivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But the
gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I am
thankful for it.


SIR NATHANIEL

Sir, I praise the Lord for you; and so may my
parishioners; for their sons are well tutored by
you, and their daughters profit very greatly under
you: you are a good member of the commonwealth.


HOLOFERNES

Mehercle, if their sons be ingenuous, they shall
want no instruction; if their daughters be capable,
I will put it to them: but vir sapit qui pauca
loquitur; a soul feminine saluteth us.
Enter JAQUENETTA and COSTARD


JAQUENETTA

God give you good morrow, master Parson.


HOLOFERNES

Master Parson, quasi pers-on. An if one should be
pierced, which is the one?


COSTARD

Marry, master schoolmaster, he that is likest to a hogshead.


HOLOFERNES

Piercing a hogshead! a good lustre of conceit in a
tuft of earth; fire enough for a flint, pearl enough
for a swine: 'tis pretty; it is well.


JAQUENETTA

Good master Parson, be so good as read me this
letter: it was given me by Costard, and sent me
from Don Armado: I beseech you, read it.


HOLOFERNES

Fauste, precor gelida quando pecus omne sub umbra
Ruminat,--and so forth. Ah, good old Mantuan! I
may speak of thee as the traveller doth of Venice;
Venetia, Venetia,
Chi non ti vede non ti pretia.
Old Mantuan, old Mantuan! who understandeth thee
not, loves thee not. Ut, re, sol, la, mi, fa.
Under pardon, sir, what are the contents? or rather,
as Horace says in his--What, my soul, verses?


SIR NATHANIEL

Ay, sir, and very learned.


HOLOFERNES

Let me hear a staff, a stanze, a verse; lege, domine.


SIR NATHANIEL

[Reads]
If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?
Ah, never faith could hold, if not to beauty vow'd!
Though to myself forsworn, to thee I'll faithful prove:
Those thoughts to me were oaks, to thee like
osiers bow'd.
Study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes,
Where all those pleasures live that art would
comprehend:
If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice;
Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend,
All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;
Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire:
Thy eye Jove's lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful thunder,
Which not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.
Celestial as thou art, O, pardon, love, this wrong,
That sings heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue.


HOLOFERNES

You find not the apostraphas, and so miss the
accent: let me supervise the canzonet. Here are
only numbers ratified; but, for the elegancy,
facility, and golden cadence of poesy, caret.
Ovidius Naso was the man: and why, indeed, Naso,
but for smelling out the odouriferous flowers of
fancy, the jerks of invention? Imitari is nothing:
so doth the hound his master, the ape his keeper,
the tired horse his rider. But, damosella virgin,
was this directed to you?


JAQUENETTA

Ay, sir, from one Monsieur Biron, one of the strange
queen's lords.


HOLOFERNES

I will overglance the superscript: 'To the
snow-white hand of the most beauteous Lady
Rosaline.' I will look again on the intellect of
the letter, for the nomination of the party writing
to the person written unto: 'Your ladyship's in all
desired employment, BIRON.' Sir Nathaniel, this
Biron is one of the votaries with the king; and here
he hath framed a letter to a sequent of the stranger
queen's, which accidentally, or by the way of
progression, hath miscarried. Trip and go, my
sweet; deliver this paper into the royal hand of the
king: it may concern much. Stay not thy
compliment; I forgive thy duty; adieu.


JAQUENETTA

Good Costard, go with me. Sir, God save your life!


COSTARD

Have with thee, my girl.
Exeunt COSTARD and JAQUENETTA


SIR NATHANIEL

Sir, you have done this in the fear of God, very
religiously; and, as a certain father saith,--


HOLOFERNES

Sir tell me not of the father; I do fear colourable
colours. But to return to the verses: did they
please you, Sir Nathaniel?


SIR NATHANIEL

Marvellous well for the pen.


HOLOFERNES

I do dine to-day at the father's of a certain pupil
of mine; where, if, before repast, it shall please
you to gratify the table with a grace, I will, on my
privilege I have with the parents of the foresaid
child or pupil, undertake your ben venuto; where I
will prove those verses to be very unlearned,
neither savouring of poetry, wit, nor invention: I
beseech your society.


SIR NATHANIEL

And thank you too; for society, saith the text, is
the happiness of life.


HOLOFERNES

And, certes, the text most infallibly concludes it.
To DULL
Sir, I do invite you too; you shall not
say me nay: pauca verba. Away! the gentles are at
their game, and we will to our recreation.
Exeunt
LOVE'S LABOURS LOST

SCENE III. The same.

Enter BIRON, with a paper


BIRON

The king he is hunting the deer; I am coursing
myself: they have pitched a toil; I am toiling in
a pitch,--pitch that defiles: defile! a foul
word. Well, set thee down, sorrow! for so they say
the fool said, and so say I, and I the fool: well
proved, wit! By the Lord, this love is as mad as
Ajax: it kills sheep; it kills me, I a sheep:
well proved again o' my side! I will not love: if
I do, hang me; i' faith, I will not. O, but her
eye,--by this light, but for her eye, I would not
love her; yes, for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing
in the world but lie, and lie in my throat. By
heaven, I do love: and it hath taught me to rhyme
and to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme,
and here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o' my
sonnets already: the clown bore it, the fool sent
it, and the lady hath it: sweet clown, sweeter
fool, sweetest lady! By the world, I would not care
a pin, if the other three were in. Here comes one
with a paper: God give him grace to groan!
Stands aside
Enter FERDINAND, with a paper


FERDINAND

Ay me!


BIRON

[Aside]  Shot, by heaven! Proceed, sweet Cupid:
thou hast thumped him with thy bird-bolt under the
left pap. In faith, secrets!


FERDINAND

[Reads]
So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not
To those fresh morning drops upon the rose,
As thy eye-beams, when their fresh rays have smote
The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows:
Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
Through the transparent bosom of the deep,
As doth thy face through tears of mine give light;
Thou shinest in every tear that I do weep:
No drop but as a coach doth carry thee;
So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.
Do but behold the tears that swell in me,
And they thy glory through my grief will show:
But do not love thyself; then thou wilt keep
My tears for glasses, and still make me weep.
O queen of queens! how far dost thou excel,
No thought can think, nor tongue of mortal tell.
How shall she know my griefs? I'll drop the paper:
Sweet leaves, shade folly. Who is he comes here?
Steps aside
What, Longaville! and reading! listen, ear.


BIRON

Now, in thy likeness, one more fool appear!
Enter LONGAVILLE, with a paper


LONGAVILLE

Ay me, I am forsworn!


BIRON

Why, he comes in like a perjure, wearing papers.


FERDINAND

In love, I hope: sweet fellowship in shame!


BIRON

One drunkard loves another of the name.


LONGAVILLE

Am I the first that have been perjured so?


BIRON

I could put thee in comfort. Not by two that I know:
Thou makest the triumviry, the corner-cap of society,
The shape of Love's Tyburn that hangs up simplicity.


LONGAVILLE

I fear these stubborn lines lack power to move:
O sweet Maria, empress of my love!
These numbers will I tear, and write in prose.


BIRON

O, rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid's hose:
Disfigure not his slop.


LONGAVILLE

This same shall go.
Reads
Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,
'Gainst whom the world cannot hold argument,
Persuade my heart to this false perjury?
Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.
A woman I forswore; but I will prove,
Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee:
My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love;
Thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me.
Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
Then thou, fair sun, which on my earth dost shine,
Exhalest this vapour-vow; in thee it is:
If broken then, it is no fault of mine:
If by me broke, what fool is not so wise
To lose an oath to win a paradise?


BIRON

This is the liver-vein, which makes flesh a deity,
A green goose a goddess: pure, pure idolatry.
God amend us, God amend! we are much out o' the way.


LONGAVILLE

By whom shall I send this?--Company! stay.
Steps aside


BIRON

All hid, all hid; an old infant play.
Like a demigod here sit I in the sky.
And wretched fools' secrets heedfully o'ereye.
More sacks to the mill! O heavens, I have my wish!
Enter DUMAIN, with a paper
Dumain transform'd! four woodcocks in a dish!


DUMAIN

O most divine Kate!


BIRON

O most profane coxcomb!


DUMAIN

By heaven, the wonder in a mortal eye!


BIRON

By earth, she is not, corporal, there you lie.


DUMAIN

Her amber hair for foul hath amber quoted.


BIRON

An amber-colour'd raven was well noted.


DUMAIN

As upright as the cedar.


BIRON

Stoop, I say;
Her shoulder is with child.


DUMAIN

As fair as day.


BIRON

Ay, as some days; but then no sun must shine.


DUMAIN

O that I had my wish!


LONGAVILLE

And I had mine!


FERDINAND

And I mine too, good Lord!


BIRON

Amen, so I had mine: is not that a good word?


DUMAIN

I would forget her; but a fever she
Reigns in my blood and will remember'd be.


BIRON

A fever in your blood! why, then incision
Would let her out in saucers: sweet misprision!


DUMAIN

Once more I'll read the ode that I have writ.


BIRON

Once more I'll mark how love can vary wit.


DUMAIN

[Reads]
On a day--alack the day!--
Love, whose month is ever May,
Spied a blossom passing fair
Playing in the wanton air:
Through the velvet leaves the wind,
All unseen, can passage find;
That the lover, sick to death,
Wish himself the heaven's breath.
Air, quoth he, thy cheeks may blow;
Air, would I might triumph so!
But, alack, my hand is sworn
Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn;
Vow, alack, for youth unmeet,
Youth so apt to pluck a sweet!
Do not call it sin in me,
That I am forsworn for thee;
Thou for whom Jove would swear
Juno but an Ethiope were;
And deny himself for Jove,
Turning mortal for thy love.
This will I send, and something else more plain,
That shall express my true love's fasting pain.
O, would the king, Biron, and Longaville,
Were lovers too! Ill, to example ill,
Would from my forehead wipe a perjured note;
For none offend where all alike do dote.


LONGAVILLE

[Advancing]  Dumain, thy love is far from charity.
You may look pale, but I should blush, I know,
To be o'erheard and taken napping so.


FERDINAND

[Advancing]  Come, sir, you blush; as his your case is such;
You chide at him, offending twice as much;
You do not love Maria; Longaville
Did never sonnet for her sake compile,
Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
His loving bosom to keep down his heart.
I have been closely shrouded in this bush
And mark'd you both and for you both did blush:
I heard your guilty rhymes, observed your fashion,
Saw sighs reek from you, noted well your passion:
Ay me! says one; O Jove! the other cries;
One, her hairs were gold, crystal the other's eyes:
To LONGAVILLE
You would for paradise break faith, and troth;
To DUMAIN
And Jove, for your love, would infringe an oath.
What will Biron say when that he shall hear
Faith so infringed, which such zeal did swear?
How will he scorn! how will he spend his wit!
How will he triumph, leap and laugh at it!
For all the wealth that ever I did see,
I would not have him know so much by me.


BIRON

Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy.
Advancing
Ah, good my liege, I pray thee, pardon me!
Good heart, what grace hast thou, thus to reprove
These worms for loving, that art most in love?
Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears
There is no certain princess that appears;
You'll not be perjured, 'tis a hateful thing;
Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting!
But are you not ashamed? nay, are you not,
All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?
You found his mote; the king your mote did see;
But I a beam do find in each of three.
O, what a scene of foolery have I seen,
Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen!
O me, with what strict patience have I sat,
To see a king transformed to a gnat!
To see great Hercules whipping a gig,
And profound Solomon to tune a jig,
And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys,
And critic Timon laugh at idle toys!
Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumain?
And gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?
And where my liege's? all about the breast:
A caudle, ho!


FERDINAND

                  Too bitter is thy jest.
Are we betray'd thus to thy over-view?


BIRON

Not you to me, but I betray'd by you:
I, that am honest; I, that hold it sin
To break the vow I am engaged in;
I am betray'd, by keeping company
With men like men of inconstancy.
When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?
Or groan for love? or spend a minute's time
In pruning me? When shall you hear that I
Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye,
A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,
A leg, a limb?


FERDINAND

                  Soft! whither away so fast?
A true man or a thief that gallops so?


BIRON

I post from love: good lover, let me go.
Enter JAQUENETTA and COSTARD


JAQUENETTA

God bless the king!


FERDINAND

What present hast thou there?


COSTARD

Some certain treason.


FERDINAND

What makes treason here?


COSTARD

Nay, it makes nothing, sir.


FERDINAND

If it mar nothing neither,
The treason and you go in peace away together.


JAQUENETTA

I beseech your grace, let this letter be read:
Our parson misdoubts it; 'twas treason, he said.


FERDINAND

Biron, read it over.
Giving him the paper
Where hadst thou it?


JAQUENETTA

Of Costard.


FERDINAND

Where hadst thou it?


COSTARD

Of Dun Adramadio, Dun Adramadio.
BIRON tears the letter


FERDINAND

How now! what is in you? why dost thou tear it?


BIRON

A toy, my liege, a toy: your grace needs not fear it.


LONGAVILLE

It did move him to passion, and therefore let's hear it.


DUMAIN

It is Biron's writing, and here is his name.
Gathering up the pieces


BIRON

[To COSTARD]  Ah, you whoreson loggerhead! you were
born to do me shame.
Guilty, my lord, guilty! I confess, I confess.


FERDINAND

What?


BIRON

That you three fools lack'd me fool to make up the mess:
He, he, and you, and you, my liege, and I,
Are pick-purses in love, and we deserve to die.
O, dismiss this audience, and I shall tell you more.


DUMAIN

Now the number is even.


BIRON

True, true; we are four.
Will these turtles be gone?


FERDINAND

Hence, sirs; away!


COSTARD

Walk aside the true folk, and let the traitors stay.
Exeunt COSTARD and JAQUENETTA


BIRON

Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!
As true we are as flesh and blood can be:
The sea will ebb and flow, heaven show his face;
Young blood doth not obey an old decree:
We cannot cross the cause why we were born;
Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn.


FERDINAND

What, did these rent lines show some love of thine?


BIRON

Did they, quoth you? Who sees the heavenly Rosaline,
That, like a rude and savage man of Inde,
At the first opening of the gorgeous east,
Bows not his vassal head and strucken blind
Kisses the base ground with obedient breast?
What peremptory eagle-sighted eye
Dares look upon the heaven of her brow,
That is not blinded by her majesty?


FERDINAND

   What zeal, what fury hath inspired thee now?
My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon;
She an attending star, scarce seen a light.


BIRON

My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Biron:
O, but for my love, day would turn to night!
Of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty
Do meet, as at a fair, in her fair cheek,
Where several worthies make one dignity,
Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek.
Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues,--
Fie, painted rhetoric! O, she needs it not:
To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,
She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.
A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,
Might shake off fifty, looking in her eye:
Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born,
And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy:
O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine.


FERDINAND

   By heaven, thy love is black as ebony.


BIRON

Is ebony like her? O wood divine!
A wife of such wood were felicity.
O, who can give an oath? where is a book?
That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack,
If that she learn not of her eye to look:
No face is fair that is not full so black.


FERDINAND

O paradox! Black is the badge of hell,
The hue of dungeons and the suit of night;
And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well.


BIRON

   Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.
O, if in black my lady's brows be deck'd,
It mourns that painting and usurping hair
Should ravish doters with a false aspect;
And therefore is she born to make black fair.
Her favour turns the fashion of the days,
For native blood is counted painting now;
And therefore red, that would avoid dispraise,
Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.


DUMAIN

To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.


LONGAVILLE

   And since her time are colliers counted bright.


FERDINAND

And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.


DUMAIN

   Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light.


BIRON

Your mistresses dare never come in rain,
For fear their colours should be wash'd away.


FERDINAND

'Twere good, yours did; for, sir, to tell you plain,
I'll find a fairer face not wash'd to-day.


BIRON

I'll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here.


FERDINAND

   No devil will fright thee then so much as she.


DUMAIN

I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear.


LONGAVILLE

   Look, here's thy love: my foot and her face see.


BIRON

O, if the streets were paved with thine eyes,
Her feet were much too dainty for such tread!


DUMAIN

O, vile! then, as she goes, what upward lies
The street should see as she walk'd overhead.


FERDINAND

But what of this? are we not all in love?


BIRON

   Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.


FERDINAND

Then leave this chat; and, good Biron, now prove
Our loving lawful, and our faith not torn.


DUMAIN

Ay, marry, there; some flattery for this evil.


LONGAVILLE

   O, some authority how to proceed;
Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil.


DUMAIN

Some salve for perjury.


BIRON

'Tis more than need.
Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.
Consider what you first did swear unto,
To fast, to study, and to see no woman;
Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.
Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;
And abstinence engenders maladies.
And where that you have vow'd to study, lords,
In that each of you have forsworn his book,
Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?
For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,
Have found the ground of study's excellence
Without the beauty of a woman's face?
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive;  They are the ground, the books, the academes From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire
Why, universal plodding poisons up
The nimble spirits in the arteries,
As motion and long-during action tires
The sinewy vigour of the traveller.
Now, for not looking on a woman's face,
You have in that forsworn the use of eyes
And study too, the causer of your vow;
For where is any author in the world
Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?
Learning is but an adjunct to ourself
And where we are our learning likewise is:
Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,
Do we not likewise see our learning there?
O, we have made a vow to study, lords,
And in that vow we have forsworn our books.
For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,
In leaden contemplation have found out
Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?
Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;
And therefore, finding barren practisers,
Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:
But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,
Lives not alone immured in the brain;
But, with the motion of all elements,
Courses as swift as thought in every power,
And gives to every power a double power,
Above their functions and their offices.
It adds a precious seeing to the eye;
A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:
Love's feeling is more soft and sensible
Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails;
Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
For valour, is not Love a Hercules,
Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?
Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical
As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair:
And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods
Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.
Never durst poet touch a pen to write
Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;
O, then his lines would ravish savage ears
And plant in tyrants mild humility.
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
They are the books, the arts, the academes,
That show, contain and nourish all the world:
Else none at all in ought proves excellent.
Then fools you were these women to forswear,
Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,
Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,
Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,
Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,
Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,
Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.
It is religion to be thus forsworn,
For charity itself fulfills the law,
And who can sever love from charity?


FERDINAND

Saint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field!


BIRON

Advance your standards, and upon them, lords;
Pell-mell, down with them! but be first advised,
In conflict that you get the sun of them.


LONGAVILLE

Now to plain-dealing; lay these glozes by:
Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?


FERDINAND

And win them too: therefore let us devise
Some entertainment for them in their tents.


BIRON

First, from the park let us conduct them thither;
Then homeward every man attach the hand
Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon
We will with some strange pastime solace them,
Such as the shortness of the time can shape;
For revels, dances, masks and merry hours
Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.


FERDINAND

Away, away! no time shall be omitted
That will betime, and may by us be fitted.


BIRON

Allons! allons! Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn;
And justice always whirls in equal measure:
Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;
If so, our copper buys no better treasure.
Exeunt
LOVE'S LABOURS LOST

ACT V
SCENE I. The same.

Enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, and DULL


HOLOFERNES

Satis quod sufficit.


SIR NATHANIEL

I praise God for you, sir: your reasons at dinner
have been sharp and sententious; pleasant without
scurrility, witty without affection, audacious without
impudency, learned without opinion, and strange with-
out heresy. I did converse this quondam day with
a companion of the king's, who is intituled, nomi-
nated, or called, Don Adriano de Armado.


HOLOFERNES

Novi hominem tanquam te: his humour is lofty, his
discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye
ambitious, his gait majestical, and his general
behavior vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is
too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it
were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.


SIR NATHANIEL

A most singular and choice epithet.
Draws out his table-book


HOLOFERNES

He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer
than the staple of his argument. I abhor such
fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and
point-devise companions; such rackers of
orthography, as to speak dout, fine, when he should
say doubt; det, when he should pronounce debt,--d,
e, b, t, not d, e, t: he clepeth a calf, cauf;
half, hauf; neighbour vocatur nebor; neigh
abbreviated ne. This is abhominable,--which he
would call abbominable: it insinuateth me of
insanie: anne intelligis, domine? to make frantic, lunatic.


SIR NATHANIEL

Laus Deo, bene intelligo.


HOLOFERNES

Bon, bon, fort bon, Priscian! a little scratch'd,
'twill serve.


SIR NATHANIEL

Videsne quis venit?


HOLOFERNES

Video, et gaudeo.
Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO, MOTH, and COSTARD
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Chirrah!
To MOTH


HOLOFERNES

Quare chirrah, not sirrah?
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Men of peace, well encountered.


HOLOFERNES

Most military sir, salutation.


MOTH

[Aside to COSTARD]  They have been at a great feast
of languages, and stolen the scraps.


COSTARD

O, they have lived long on the alms-basket of words.
I marvel thy master hath not eaten thee for a word;
for thou art not so long by the head as
honorificabilitudinitatibus: thou art easier
swallowed than a flap-dragon.


MOTH

Peace! the peal begins.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

[To HOLOFERNES]  Monsieur, are you not lettered?


MOTH

Yes, yes; he teaches boys the hornbook. What is a,
b, spelt backward, with the horn on his head?


HOLOFERNES

Ba, pueritia, with a horn added.


MOTH

Ba, most silly sheep with a horn. You hear his learning.


HOLOFERNES

Quis, quis, thou consonant?


MOTH

The third of the five vowels, if you repeat them; or
the fifth, if I.


HOLOFERNES

I will repeat them,--a, e, i,--


MOTH

The sheep: the other two concludes it,--o, u.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Now, by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum, a sweet
touch, a quick venue of wit! snip, snap, quick and
home! it rejoiceth my intellect: true wit!


MOTH

Offered by a child to an old man; which is wit-old.


HOLOFERNES

What is the figure? what is the figure?


MOTH

Horns.


HOLOFERNES

Thou disputest like an infant: go, whip thy gig.


MOTH

Lend me your horn to make one, and I will whip about
your infamy circum circa,--a gig of a cuckold's horn.


COSTARD

An I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst
have it to buy gingerbread: hold, there is the very
remuneration I had of thy master, thou halfpenny
purse of wit, thou pigeon-egg of discretion. O, an
the heavens were so pleased that thou wert but my
bastard, what a joyful father wouldst thou make me!
Go to; thou hast it ad dunghill, at the fingers'
ends, as they say.


HOLOFERNES

O, I smell false Latin; dunghill for unguem.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Arts-man, preambulate, we will be singled from the
barbarous. Do you not educate youth at the
charge-house on the top of the mountain?


HOLOFERNES

Or mons, the hill.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.


HOLOFERNES

I do, sans question.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Sir, it is the king's most sweet pleasure and
affection to congratulate the princess at her
pavilion in the posteriors of this day, which the
rude multitude call the afternoon.


HOLOFERNES

The posterior of the day, most generous sir, is
liable, congruent and measurable for the afternoon:
the word is well culled, chose, sweet and apt, I do
assure you, sir, I do assure.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Sir, the king is a noble gentleman, and my familiar,
I do assure ye, very good friend: for what is
inward between us, let it pass. I do beseech thee,
remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee, apparel thy
head: and among other important and most serious
designs, and of great import indeed, too, but let
that pass: for I must tell thee, it will please his
grace, by the world, sometime to lean upon my poor
shoulder, and with his royal finger, thus, dally
with my excrement, with my mustachio; but, sweet
heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no
fable: some certain special honours it pleaseth his
greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of
travel, that hath seen the world; but let that pass.
The very all of all is,--but, sweet heart, I do
implore secrecy,--that the king would have me
present the princess, sweet chuck, with some
delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or
antique, or firework. Now, understanding that the
curate and your sweet self are good at such
eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth, as it
were, I have acquainted you withal, to the end to
crave your assistance.


HOLOFERNES

Sir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies.
Sir, as concerning some entertainment of time, some
show in the posterior of this day, to be rendered by
our assistants, at the king's command, and this most
gallant, illustrate, and learned gentleman, before
the princess; I say none so fit as to present the
Nine Worthies.


SIR NATHANIEL

Where will you find men worthy enough to present them?


HOLOFERNES

Joshua, yourself; myself and this gallant gentleman,
Judas Maccabaeus; this swain, because of his great
limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the Great; the
page, Hercules,--
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Pardon, sir; error: he is not quantity enough for
that Worthy's thumb: he is not so big as the end of his club.


HOLOFERNES

Shall I have audience? he shall present Hercules in
minority: his enter and exit shall be strangling a
snake; and I will have an apology for that purpose.


MOTH

An excellent device! so, if any of the audience
hiss, you may cry 'Well done, Hercules! now thou
crushest the snake!' that is the way to make an
offence gracious, though few have the grace to do it.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

For the rest of the Worthies?--


HOLOFERNES

I will play three myself.


MOTH

Thrice-worthy gentleman!
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Shall I tell you a thing?


HOLOFERNES

We attend.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

We will have, if this fadge not, an antique. I
beseech you, follow.


HOLOFERNES

Via, goodman Dull! thou hast spoken no word all this while.


DULL

Nor understood none neither, sir.


HOLOFERNES

Allons! we will employ thee.


DULL

I'll make one in a dance, or so; or I will play
On the tabour to the Worthies, and let them dance the hay.


HOLOFERNES

Most dull, honest Dull! To our sport, away!
Exeunt
LOVE'S LABOURS LOST

SCENE II. The same.

Enter the PRINCESS, KATHARINE, ROSALINE, and MARIA


PRINCESS

Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,
If fairings come thus plentifully in:
A lady wall'd about with diamonds!
Look you what I have from the loving king.


ROSALINE

Madame, came nothing else along with that?


PRINCESS

Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme
As would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper,
Writ o' both sides the leaf, margent and all,
That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name.


ROSALINE

That was the way to make his godhead wax,
For he hath been five thousand years a boy.


KATHARINE

Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.


ROSALINE

You'll ne'er be friends with him; a' kill'd your sister.


KATHARINE

He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;
And so she died: had she been light, like you,
Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,
She might ha' been a grandam ere she died:
And so may you; for a light heart lives long.


ROSALINE

What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?


KATHARINE

A light condition in a beauty dark.


ROSALINE

We need more light to find your meaning out.


KATHARINE

You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
Therefore I'll darkly end the argument.


ROSALINE

Look what you do, you do it still i' the dark.


KATHARINE

So do not you, for you are a light wench.


ROSALINE

Indeed I weigh not you, and therefore light.


KATHARINE

You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.


ROSALINE

Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'


PRINCESS

Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.
But Rosaline, you have a favour too:
Who sent it? and what is it?


ROSALINE

I would you knew:
An if my face were but as fair as yours,
My favour were as great; be witness this.
Nay, I have verses too, I thank Biron:
The numbers true; and, were the numbering too,
I were the fairest goddess on the ground:
I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.
O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!


PRINCESS

Any thing like?


ROSALINE

Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.


PRINCESS

Beauteous as ink; a good conclusion.


KATHARINE

Fair as a text B in a copy-book.


ROSALINE

'Ware pencils, ho! let me not die your debtor,
My red dominical, my golden letter:
O, that your face were not so full of O's!


KATHARINE

A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows.


PRINCESS

But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumain?


KATHARINE

Madam, this glove.


PRINCESS

                  Did he not send you twain?


KATHARINE

Yes, madam, and moreover
Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,
A huge translation of hypocrisy,
Vilely compiled, profound simplicity.


MARIA

This and these pearls to me sent Longaville:
The letter is too long by half a mile.


PRINCESS

I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
The chain were longer and the letter short?


MARIA

Ay, or I would these hands might never part.


PRINCESS

We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.


ROSALINE

They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
That same Biron I'll torture ere I go:
O that I knew he were but in by the week!
How I would make him fawn and beg and seek
And wait the season and observe the times
And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes
And shape his service wholly to my hests
And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his state
That he should be my fool and I his fate.


PRINCESS

None are so surely caught, when they are catch'd,
As wit turn'd fool: folly, in wisdom hatch'd,
Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school
And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.


ROSALINE

The blood of youth burns not with such excess
As gravity's revolt to wantonness.


MARIA

Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
As foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote;
Since all the power thereof it doth apply
To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.


PRINCESS

Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.
Enter BOYET


BOYET

O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her grace?


PRINCESS

Thy news Boyet?


BOYET

                  Prepare, madam, prepare!
Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted are
Against your peace: Love doth approach disguised,
Armed in arguments; you'll be surprised:
Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;
Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.


PRINCESS

Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they
That charge their breath against us? say, scout, say.


BOYET

Under the cool shade of a sycamore
I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;
When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,
Toward that shade I might behold addrest
The king and his companions: warily
I stole into a neighbour thicket by,
And overheard what you shall overhear,
That, by and by, disguised they will be here.
Their herald is a pretty knavish page,
That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:
Action and accent did they teach him there;
'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'
And ever and anon they made a doubt
Presence majestical would put him out,
'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;
Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'
The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;
I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'
With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,
Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:
One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore
A better speech was never spoke before;
Another, with his finger and his thumb,
Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'
The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well;'
The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.
With that, they all did tumble on the ground,
With such a zealous laughter, so profound,
That in this spleen ridiculous appears,
To cheque their folly, passion's solemn tears.


PRINCESS

But what, but what, come they to visit us?


BOYET

They do, they do: and are apparell'd thus.
Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.
Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;
And every one his love-feat will advance
Unto his several mistress, which they'll know
By favours several which they did bestow.


PRINCESS

And will they so? the gallants shall be task'd;
For, ladies, we shall every one be mask'd;
And not a man of them shall have the grace,
Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.
Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,
And then the king will court thee for his dear;
Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,
So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.
And change your favours too; so shall your loves
Woo contrary, deceived by these removes.


ROSALINE

Come on, then; wear the favours most in sight.


KATHARINE

But in this changing what is your intent?


PRINCESS

The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:
They do it but in mocking merriment;
And mock for mock is only my intent.
Their several counsels they unbosom shall
To loves mistook, and so be mock'd withal
Upon the next occasion that we meet,
With visages displayed, to talk and greet.


ROSALINE

But shall we dance, if they desire to't?


PRINCESS

No, to the death, we will not move a foot;
Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace,
But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.


BOYET

Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,
And quite divorce his memory from his part.


PRINCESS

Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt
The rest will ne'er come in, if he be out
There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,
To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:
So shall we stay, mocking intended game,
And they, well mock'd, depart away with shame.
Trumpets sound within


BOYET

The trumpet sounds: be mask'd; the maskers come.
The Ladies mask
Enter Blackamoors with music; MOTH; FERDINAND,  BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, in Russian habits, and masked


MOTH

All hail, the richest beauties on the earth!--


BOYET

Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.


MOTH

A holy parcel of the fairest dames.
The Ladies turn their backs to him
That ever turn'd their--backs--to mortal views!


BIRON

[Aside to MOTH]  Their eyes, villain, their eyes!


MOTH

That ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views!--Out--


BOYET

True; out indeed.


MOTH

Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe
Not to behold--


BIRON

[Aside to MOTH]  Once to behold, rogue.


MOTH

Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes,
--with your sun-beamed eyes--


BOYET

They will not answer to that epithet;
You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.'


MOTH

They do not mark me, and that brings me out.


BIRON

Is this your perfectness? be gone, you rogue!
Exit MOTH


ROSALINE

What would these strangers? know their minds, Boyet:
If they do speak our language, 'tis our will:
That some plain man recount their purposes
Know what they would.


BOYET

What would you with the princess?


BIRON

Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.


ROSALINE

What would they, say they?


BOYET

Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.


ROSALINE

Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.


BOYET

She says, you have it, and you may be gone.


FERDINAND

Say to her, we have measured many miles
To tread a measure with her on this grass.


BOYET

They say, that they have measured many a mile
To tread a measure with you on this grass.


ROSALINE

It is not so. Ask them how many inches
Is in one mile: if they have measured many,
The measure then of one is easily told.


BOYET

If to come hither you have measured miles,
And many miles, the princess bids you tell
How many inches doth fill up one mile.


BIRON

Tell her, we measure them by weary steps.


BOYET

She hears herself.


ROSALINE

                  How many weary steps,
Of many weary miles you have o'ergone,
Are number'd in the travel of one mile?


BIRON

We number nothing that we spend for you:
Our duty is so rich, so infinite,
That we may do it still without accompt.
Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,
That we, like savages, may worship it.


ROSALINE

My face is but a moon, and clouded too.


FERDINAND

Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!
Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,
Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.


ROSALINE

O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;
Thou now request'st but moonshine in the water.


FERDINAND

Then, in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.
Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange.


ROSALINE

Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.
Music plays
Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.


FERDINAND

Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?


ROSALINE

You took the moon at full, but now she's changed.


FERDINAND

Yet still she is the moon, and I the man.
The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.


ROSALINE

Our ears vouchsafe it.


FERDINAND

But your legs should do it.


ROSALINE

Since you are strangers and come here by chance,
We'll not be nice: take hands. We will not dance.


FERDINAND

Why take we hands, then?


ROSALINE

Only to part friends:
Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.


FERDINAND

More measure of this measure; be not nice.


ROSALINE

We can afford no more at such a price.


FERDINAND

Prize you yourselves: what buys your company?


ROSALINE

Your absence only.


FERDINAND

                  That can never be.


ROSALINE

Then cannot we be bought: and so, adieu;
Twice to your visor, and half once to you.


FERDINAND

If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.


ROSALINE

In private, then.


FERDINAND

                  I am best pleased with that.
They converse apart


BIRON

White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.


PRINCESS

Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is three.


BIRON

Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
Metheglin, wort, and malmsey: well run, dice!
There's half-a-dozen sweets.


PRINCESS

Seventh sweet, adieu:
Since you can cog, I'll play no more with you.


BIRON

One word in secret.


PRINCESS

Let it not be sweet.


BIRON

Thou grievest my gall.


PRINCESS

Gall! bitter.


BIRON

Therefore meet.
They converse apart


DUMAIN

Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word?


MARIA

Name it.


DUMAIN

       Fair lady,--


MARIA

Say you so? Fair lord,--
Take that for your fair lady.


DUMAIN

Please it you,
As much in private, and I'll bid adieu.
They converse apart


KATHARINE

What, was your vizard made without a tongue?


LONGAVILLE

I know the reason, lady, why you ask.


KATHARINE

O for your reason! quickly, sir; I long.


LONGAVILLE

You have a double tongue within your mask,
And would afford my speechless vizard half.


KATHARINE

Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?


LONGAVILLE

A calf, fair lady!


KATHARINE

                  No, a fair lord calf.


LONGAVILLE

Let's part the word.


KATHARINE

No, I'll not be your half
Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.


LONGAVILLE

Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
Will you give horns, chaste lady? do not so.


KATHARINE

Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.


LONGAVILLE

One word in private with you, ere I die.


KATHARINE

Bleat softly then; the butcher hears you cry.
They converse apart


BOYET

The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
As is the razor's edge invisible,
Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,
Above the sense of sense; so sensible
Seemeth their conference; their conceits have wings
Fleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things.


ROSALINE

Not one word more, my maids; break off, break off.


BIRON

By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!


FERDINAND

Farewell, mad wenches; you have simple wits.


PRINCESS

Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovits.
Exeunt FERDINAND, Lords, and Blackamoors
Are these the breed of wits so wonder'd at?


BOYET

Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out.


ROSALINE

Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.


PRINCESS

O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
Will they not, think you, hang themselves tonight?
Or ever, but in vizards, show their faces?
This pert Biron was out of countenance quite.


ROSALINE

O, they were all in lamentable cases!
The king was weeping-ripe for a good word.


PRINCESS

Biron did swear himself out of all suit.


MARIA

Dumain was at my service, and his sword:
No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute.


KATHARINE

Lord Longaville said, I came o'er his heart;
And trow you what he called me?


PRINCESS

Qualm, perhaps.


KATHARINE

Yes, in good faith.


PRINCESS

Go, sickness as thou art!


ROSALINE

Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps.
But will you hear? the king is my love sworn.


PRINCESS

And quick Biron hath plighted faith to me.


KATHARINE

And Longaville was for my service born.


MARIA

Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.


BOYET

Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:
Immediately they will again be here
In their own shapes; for it can never be
They will digest this harsh indignity.


PRINCESS

Will they return?


BOYET

                  They will, they will, God knows,
And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows:
Therefore change favours; and, when they repair,
Blow like sweet roses in this summer air.


PRINCESS

How blow? how blow? speak to be understood.


BOYET

Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud;
Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,
Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown.


PRINCESS

Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do,
If they return in their own shapes to woo?


ROSALINE

Good madam, if by me you'll be advised,
Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised:
Let us complain to them what fools were here,
Disguised like Muscovites, in shapeless gear;
And wonder what they were and to what end
Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'd
And their rough carriage so ridiculous,
Should be presented at our tent to us.


BOYET

Ladies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand.


PRINCESS

Whip to our tents, as roes run o'er land.
Exeunt PRINCESS, ROSALINE, KATHARINE, and MARIA
Re-enter FERDINAND, BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, in their proper habits


FERDINAND

Fair sir, God save you! Where's the princess?


BOYET

Gone to her tent. Please it your majesty
Command me any service to her thither?


FERDINAND

That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.


BOYET

I will; and so will she, I know, my lord.
Exit


BIRON

This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,
And utters it again when God doth please:
He is wit's pedler, and retails his wares
At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;
And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,
Have not the grace to grace it with such show.
This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;
Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve;
A' can carve too, and lisp: why, this is he
That kiss'd his hand away in courtesy;
This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice,
That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice
In honourable terms: nay, he can sing
A mean most meanly; and in ushering
Mend him who can: the ladies call him sweet;
The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet:
This is the flower that smiles on every one,
To show his teeth as white as whale's bone;
And consciences, that will not die in debt,
Pay him the due of honey-tongued Boyet.


FERDINAND

A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,
That put Armado's page out of his part!


BIRON

See where it comes! Behavior, what wert thou
Till this madman show'd thee? and what art thou now?
Re-enter the PRINCESS, ushered by BOYET, ROSALINE, MARIA, and KATHARINE


FERDINAND

All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day!


PRINCESS

'Fair' in 'all hail' is foul, as I conceive.


FERDINAND

Construe my speeches better, if you may.


PRINCESS

Then wish me better; I will give you leave.


FERDINAND

We came to visit you, and purpose now
To lead you to our court; vouchsafe it then.


PRINCESS

This field shall hold me; and so hold your vow:
Nor God, nor I, delights in perjured men.


FERDINAND

Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
The virtue of your eye must break my oath.


PRINCESS

You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;
For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.
Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure
As the unsullied lily, I protest,
A world of torments though I should endure,
I would not yield to be your house's guest;
So much I hate a breaking cause to be
Of heavenly oaths, vow'd with integrity.


FERDINAND

O, you have lived in desolation here,
Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.


PRINCESS

Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;
We have had pastimes here and pleasant game:
A mess of Russians left us but of late.


FERDINAND

How, madam! Russians!


PRINCESS

Ay, in truth, my lord;
Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.


ROSALINE

Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord:
My lady, to the manner of the days,
In courtesy gives undeserving praise.
We four indeed confronted were with four
In Russian habit: here they stay'd an hour,
And talk'd apace; and in that hour, my lord,
They did not bless us with one happy word.
I dare not call them fools; but this I think,
When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.


BIRON

This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,
Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,
With eyes best seeing, heaven's fiery eye,
By light we lose light: your capacity
Is of that nature that to your huge store
Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.


ROSALINE

This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye,--


BIRON

I am a fool, and full of poverty.


ROSALINE

But that you take what doth to you belong,
It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.


BIRON

O, I am yours, and all that I possess!


ROSALINE

All the fool mine?


BIRON

                  I cannot give you less.


ROSALINE

Which of the vizards was it that you wore?


BIRON

Where? when? what vizard? why demand you this?


ROSALINE

There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case
That hid the worse and show'd the better face.


FERDINAND

We are descried; they'll mock us now downright.


DUMAIN

Let us confess and turn it to a jest.


PRINCESS

Amazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad?


ROSALINE

Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?
Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy.


BIRON

Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.
Can any face of brass hold longer out?


Here stand I

lady, dart thy skill at me;
Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout;
Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance;
Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;
And I will wish thee never more to dance,
Nor never more in Russian habit wait.
O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd,
Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,
Nor never come in vizard to my friend,
Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!
Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,
Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,
Figures pedantical; these summer-flies
Have blown me full of maggot ostentation:
I do forswear them; and I here protest,
By this white glove;--how white the hand, God knows!--
Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd
In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:
And, to begin, wench,--so God help me, la!--
My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.


ROSALINE

Sans sans, I pray you.


BIRON

Yet I have a trick
Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;
I'll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see:
Write, 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three;
They are infected; in their hearts it lies;
They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes;
These lords are visited; you are not free,
For the Lord's tokens on you do I see.


PRINCESS

No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.


BIRON

Our states are forfeit: seek not to undo us.


ROSALINE

It is not so; for how can this be true,
That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?


BIRON

Peace! for I will not have to do with you.


ROSALINE

Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.


BIRON

Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.


FERDINAND

Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression
Some fair excuse.


PRINCESS

                  The fairest is confession.
Were not you here but even now disguised?


FERDINAND

Madam, I was.


PRINCESS

                  And were you well advised?


FERDINAND

I was, fair madam.


PRINCESS

                  When you then were here,
What did you whisper in your lady's ear?


FERDINAND

That more than all the world I did respect her.


PRINCESS

When she shall challenge this, you will reject her.


FERDINAND

Upon mine honour, no.


PRINCESS

Peace, peace! forbear:
Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.


FERDINAND

Despise me, when I break this oath of mine.


PRINCESS

I will: and therefore keep it. Rosaline,
What did the Russian whisper in your ear?


ROSALINE

Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear
As precious eyesight, and did value me
Above this world; adding thereto moreover
That he would wed me, or else die my lover.


PRINCESS

God give thee joy of him! the noble lord
Most honourably doth unhold his word.


FERDINAND

What mean you, madam? by my life, my troth,
I never swore this lady such an oath.


ROSALINE

By heaven, you did; and to confirm it plain,
You gave me this: but take it, sir, again.


FERDINAND

My faith and this the princess I did give:
I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.


PRINCESS

Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;
And Lord Biron, I thank him, is my dear.
What, will you have me, or your pearl again?


BIRON

Neither of either; I remit both twain.
I see the trick on't: here was a consent,
Knowing aforehand of our merriment,
To dash it like a Christmas comedy:
Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,
Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,
That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
To make my lady laugh when she's disposed,
Told our intents before; which once disclosed,
The ladies did change favours: and then we,
Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.
Now, to our perjury to add more terror,
We are again forsworn, in will and error.
Much upon this it is: and might not you
To BOYET
Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?
Do not you know my lady's foot by the squier,
And laugh upon the apple of her eye?
And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,
Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?
You put our page out: go, you are allow'd;
Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
You leer upon me, do you? there's an eye
Wounds like a leaden sword.


BOYET

Full merrily
Hath this brave manage, this career, been run.


BIRON

Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace! I have done.
Enter COSTARD
Welcome, pure wit! thou partest a fair fray.


COSTARD

O Lord, sir, they would know
Whether the three Worthies shall come in or no.


BIRON

What, are there but three?


COSTARD

No, sir; but it is vara fine,
For every one pursents three.


BIRON

And three times thrice is nine.


COSTARD

Not so, sir; under correction, sir; I hope it is not so.
You cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir we know
what we know:
I hope, sir, three times thrice, sir,--


BIRON

Is not nine.


COSTARD

Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.


BIRON

By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.


COSTARD

O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living
by reckoning, sir.


BIRON

How much is it?


COSTARD

O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors,
sir, will show whereuntil it doth amount: for mine
own part, I am, as they say, but to parfect one man
in one poor man, Pompion the Great, sir.


BIRON

Art thou one of the Worthies?


COSTARD

It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompion the
Great: for mine own part, I know not the degree of
the Worthy, but I am to stand for him.


BIRON

Go, bid them prepare.


COSTARD

We will turn it finely off, sir; we will take
some care.
Exit


FERDINAND

Biron, they will shame us: let them not approach.


BIRON

We are shame-proof, my lord: and tis some policy
To have one show worse than the king's and his company.


FERDINAND

I say they shall not come.


PRINCESS

Nay, my good lord, let me o'errule you now:
That sport best pleases that doth least know how:
Where zeal strives to content, and the contents
Dies in the zeal of that which it presents:
Their form confounded makes most form in mirth,
When great things labouring perish in their birth.


BIRON

A right description of our sport, my lord.
Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Anointed, I implore so much expense of thy royal
sweet breath as will utter a brace of words.
Converses apart with FERDINAND, and delivers him a paper


PRINCESS

Doth this man serve God?


BIRON

Why ask you?


PRINCESS

He speaks not like a man of God's making.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

That is all one, my fair, sweet, honey monarch; for,
I protest, the schoolmaster is exceeding
fantastical; too, too vain, too too vain: but we
will put it, as they say, to fortuna de la guerra.
I wish you the peace of mind, most royal couplement!
Exit


FERDINAND

Here is like to be a good presence of Worthies. He
presents Hector of Troy; the swain, Pompey the
Great; the parish curate, Alexander; Armado's page,
Hercules; the pedant, Judas Maccabaeus: And if
these four Worthies in their first show thrive,
These four will change habits, and present the other five.


BIRON

There is five in the first show.


FERDINAND

You are deceived; 'tis not so.


BIRON

The pedant, the braggart, the hedge-priest, the fool
and the boy:--
Abate throw at novum, and the whole world again
Cannot pick out five such, take each one in his vein.


FERDINAND

The ship is under sail, and here she comes amain.
Enter COSTARD, for Pompey


COSTARD

I Pompey am,--


BOYET

                  You lie, you are not he.


COSTARD

I Pompey am,--


BOYET

                  With libbard's head on knee.


BIRON

Well said, old mocker: I must needs be friends
with thee.


COSTARD

I Pompey am, Pompey surnamed the Big--


DUMAIN

The Great.


COSTARD

It is, 'Great,' sir:--
Pompey surnamed the Great;
That oft in field, with targe and shield, did make
my foe to sweat:
And travelling along this coast, I here am come by chance,
And lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of France,
If your ladyship would say, 'Thanks, Pompey,' I had done.


PRINCESS

Great thanks, great Pompey.


COSTARD

'Tis not so much worth; but I hope I was perfect: I
made a little fault in 'Great.'


BIRON

My hat to a halfpenny, Pompey proves the best Worthy.
Enter SIR NATHANIEL, for Alexander


SIR NATHANIEL

When in the world I lived, I was the world's
commander;
By east, west, north, and south, I spread my
conquering might:
My scutcheon plain declares that I am Alisander,--


BOYET

Your nose says, no, you are not for it stands too right.


BIRON

Your nose smells 'no' in this, most tender-smelling knight.


PRINCESS

The conqueror is dismay'd. Proceed, good Alexander.


SIR NATHANIEL

When in the world I lived, I was the world's
commander,--


BOYET

Most true, 'tis right; you were so, Alisander.


BIRON

Pompey the Great,--


COSTARD

Your servant, and Costard.


BIRON

Take away the conqueror, take away Alisander.


COSTARD

[To SIR NATHANIEL]  O, sir, you have overthrown
Alisander the conqueror! You will be scraped out of
the painted cloth for this: your lion, that holds
his poll-axe sitting on a close-stool, will be given
to Ajax: he will be the ninth Worthy. A conqueror,
and afeard to speak! run away for shame, Alisander.
SIR NATHANIEL retires
There, an't shall please you; a foolish mild man; an
honest man, look you, and soon dashed. He is a
marvellous good neighbour, faith, and a very good
bowler: but, for Alisander,--alas, you see how
'tis,--a little o'erparted. But there are Worthies
a-coming will speak their mind in some other sort.
Enter HOLOFERNES, for Judas; and MOTH, for Hercules


HOLOFERNES

   Great Hercules is presented by this imp,
Whose club kill'd Cerberus, that three-headed canis;
And when he was a babe, a child, a shrimp,
Thus did he strangle serpents in his manus.
Quoniam he seemeth in minority,
Ergo I come with this apology.
Keep some state in thy exit, and vanish.
MOTH retires
Judas I am,--


DUMAIN

A Judas!


HOLOFERNES

Not Iscariot, sir.
Judas I am, ycliped Maccabaeus.


DUMAIN

Judas Maccabaeus clipt is plain Judas.


BIRON

A kissing traitor. How art thou proved Judas?


HOLOFERNES

Judas I am,--


DUMAIN

The more shame for you, Judas.


HOLOFERNES

What mean you, sir?


BOYET

To make Judas hang himself.


HOLOFERNES

Begin, sir; you are my elder.


BIRON

Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder.


HOLOFERNES

I will not be put out of countenance.


BIRON

Because thou hast no face.


HOLOFERNES

What is this?


BOYET

A cittern-head.


DUMAIN

The head of a bodkin.


BIRON

A Death's face in a ring.


LONGAVILLE

The face of an old Roman coin, scarce seen.


BOYET

The pommel of Caesar's falchion.


DUMAIN

The carved-bone face on a flask.


BIRON

Saint George's half-cheek in a brooch.


DUMAIN

Ay, and in a brooch of lead.


BIRON

Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer.
And now forward; for we have put thee in countenance.


HOLOFERNES

You have put me out of countenance.


BIRON

False; we have given thee faces.


HOLOFERNES

But you have out-faced them all.


BIRON

An thou wert a lion, we would do so.


BOYET

Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go.
And so adieu, sweet Jude! nay, why dost thou stay?


DUMAIN

For the latter end of his name.


BIRON

For the ass to the Jude; give it him:--Jud-as, away!


HOLOFERNES

This is not generous, not gentle, not humble.


BOYET

A light for Monsieur Judas! it grows dark, he may stumble.
HOLOFERNES retires


PRINCESS

Alas, poor Maccabaeus, how hath he been baited!
Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO, for Hector


BIRON

Hide thy head, Achilles: here comes Hector in arms.


DUMAIN

Though my mocks come home by me, I will now be merry.


FERDINAND

Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this.


BOYET

But is this Hector?


FERDINAND

I think Hector was not so clean-timbered.


LONGAVILLE

His leg is too big for Hector's.


DUMAIN

More calf, certain.


BOYET

No; he is best endued in the small.


BIRON

This cannot be Hector.


DUMAIN

He's a god or a painter; for he makes faces.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,
Gave Hector a gift,--


DUMAIN

A gilt nutmeg.


BIRON

A lemon.


LONGAVILLE

Stuck with cloves.


DUMAIN

No, cloven.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Peace!--
The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty
Gave Hector a gift, the heir of Ilion;
A man so breathed, that certain he would fight; yea
From morn till night, out of his pavilion.
I am that flower,--


DUMAIN

That mint.


LONGAVILLE

That columbine.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Sweet Lord Longaville, rein thy tongue.


LONGAVILLE

I must rather give it the rein, for it runs against Hector.


DUMAIN

Ay, and Hector's a greyhound.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

The sweet war-man is dead and rotten; sweet chucks,
beat not the bones of the buried: when he breathed,
he was a man. But I will forward with my device.
To the PRINCESS
Sweet royalty, bestow on me the sense of hearing.


PRINCESS

Speak, brave Hector: we are much delighted.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

I do adore thy sweet grace's slipper.


BOYET

[Aside to DUMAIN]  Loves her by the foot,--


DUMAIN

[Aside to BOYET]  He may not by the yard.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

This Hector far surmounted Hannibal,--


COSTARD

The party is gone, fellow Hector, she is gone; she
is two months on her way.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

What meanest thou?


COSTARD

Faith, unless you play the honest Troyan, the poor
wench is cast away: she's quick; the child brags in
her belly already: tis yours.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? thou shalt
die.


COSTARD

Then shall Hector be whipped for Jaquenetta that is
quick by him and hanged for Pompey that is dead by
him.


DUMAIN

Most rare Pompey!


BOYET

Renowned Pompey!


BIRON

Greater than great, great, great, great Pompey!
Pompey the Huge!


DUMAIN

Hector trembles.


BIRON

Pompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! stir them
on! stir them on!


DUMAIN

Hector will challenge him.


BIRON

Ay, if a' have no man's blood in's belly than will
sup a flea.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

By the north pole, I do challenge thee.


COSTARD

I will not fight with a pole, like a northern man:
I'll slash; I'll do it by the sword. I bepray you,
let me borrow my arms again.


DUMAIN

Room for the incensed Worthies!


COSTARD

I'll do it in my shirt.


DUMAIN

Most resolute Pompey!


MOTH

Master, let me take you a buttonhole lower. Do you
not see Pompey is uncasing for the combat? What mean
you? You will lose your reputation.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I will not combat
in my shirt.


DUMAIN

You may not deny it: Pompey hath made the challenge.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Sweet bloods, I both may and will.


BIRON

What reason have you for't?
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

The naked truth of it is, I have no shirt; I go
woolward for penance.


BOYET

True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of
linen: since when, I'll be sworn, he wore none but
a dishclout of Jaquenetta's, and that a' wears next
his heart for a favour.
Enter MERCADE


MERCADE

God save you, madam!


PRINCESS

Welcome, Mercade;
But that thou interrupt'st our merriment.


MERCADE

I am sorry, madam; for the news I bring
Is heavy in my tongue. The king your father--


PRINCESS

Dead, for my life!


MERCADE

Even so; my tale is told.


BIRON

Worthies, away! the scene begins to cloud.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

For mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have
seen the day of wrong through the little hole of
discretion, and I will right myself like a soldier.
Exeunt Worthies


FERDINAND

How fares your majesty?


PRINCESS

Boyet, prepare; I will away tonight.


FERDINAND

Madam, not so; I do beseech you, stay.


PRINCESS

Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,
For all your fair endeavors; and entreat,
Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe
In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
The liberal opposition of our spirits,
If over-boldly we have borne ourselves
In the converse of breath: your gentleness
Was guilty of it. Farewell worthy lord!
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue:
Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
For my great suit so easily obtain'd.


FERDINAND

The extreme parts of time extremely forms
All causes to the purpose of his speed,
And often at his very loose decides
That which long process could not arbitrate:
And though the mourning brow of progeny
Forbid the smiling courtesy of love
The holy suit which fain it would convince,
Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,
Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
From what it purposed; since, to wail friends lost
Is not by much so wholesome-profitable
As to rejoice at friends but newly found.


PRINCESS

I understand you not: my griefs are double.


BIRON

Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;
And by these badges understand the king.
For your fair sakes have we neglected time,
Play'd foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,
Hath much deform'd us, fashioning our humours
Even to the opposed end of our intents:
And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,--
As love is full of unbefitting strains,
All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,
Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye,
Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,
Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
To every varied object in his glance:
Which parti-coated presence of loose love
Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,
Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,
Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,
Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,
Our love being yours, the error that love makes
Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,
By being once false for ever to be true
To those that make us both,--fair ladies, you:
And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,
Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.


PRINCESS

We have received your letters full of love;
Your favours, the ambassadors of love;
And, in our maiden council, rated them
At courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy,
As bombast and as lining to the time:
But more devout than this in our respects
Have we not been; and therefore met your loves
In their own fashion, like a merriment.


DUMAIN

Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.


LONGAVILLE

So did our looks.


ROSALINE

                  We did not quote them so.


FERDINAND

Now, at the latest minute of the hour,
Grant us your loves.


PRINCESS

A time, methinks, too short
To make a world-without-end bargain in.
No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,
Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:
If for my love, as there is no such cause,
You will do aught, this shall you do for me:
Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed
To some forlorn and naked hermitage,
Remote from all the pleasures of the world;
There stay until the twelve celestial signs
Have brought about the annual reckoning.
If this austere insociable life
Change not your offer made in heat of blood;
If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds
Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,
But that it bear this trial and last love;
Then, at the expiration of the year,
Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,
And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine
I will be thine; and till that instant shut
My woeful self up in a mourning house,
Raining the tears of lamentation
For the remembrance of my father's death.
If this thou do deny, let our hands part,
Neither entitled in the other's heart.


FERDINAND

If this, or more than this, I would deny,
To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,
The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!
Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.


DUMAIN

But what to me, my love? but what to me? A wife?


KATHARINE

A beard, fair health, and honesty;
With three-fold love I wish you all these three.


DUMAIN

O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?


KATHARINE

Not so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day
I'll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say:
Come when the king doth to my lady come;
Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.


DUMAIN

I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.


KATHARINE

Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.


LONGAVILLE

What says Maria?


MARIA

                  At the twelvemonth's end
I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.


LONGAVILLE

I'll stay with patience; but the time is long.


MARIA

The liker you; few taller are so young.


BIRON

Studies my lady? mistress, look on me;
Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,
What humble suit attends thy answer there:
Impose some service on me for thy love.


ROSALINE

Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Biron,
Before I saw you; and the world's large tongue
Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,
Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,
Which you on all estates will execute
That lie within the mercy of your wit.
To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,
And therewithal to win me, if you please,
Without the which I am not to be won,
You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
Visit the speechless sick and still converse
With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,
With all the fierce endeavor of your wit
To enforce the pained impotent to smile.


BIRON

To move wild laughter in the throat of death?
It cannot be; it is impossible:
Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.


ROSALINE

Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,
Whose influence is begot of that loose grace
Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools:
A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
Of him that hears it, never in the tongue
Of him that makes it: then, if sickly ears,
Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,
And I will have you and that fault withal;
But if they will not, throw away that spirit,
And I shall find you empty of that fault,
Right joyful of your reformation.


BIRON

A twelvemonth! well; befall what will befall,
I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.


PRINCESS

[To FERDINAND]  Ay, sweet my lord; and so I take my leave.


FERDINAND

No, madam; we will bring you on your way.


BIRON

Our wooing doth not end like an old play;
Jack hath not Jill: these ladies' courtesy
Might well have made our sport a comedy.


FERDINAND

Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth and a day,
And then 'twill end.


BIRON

That's too long for a play.
Re-enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Sweet majesty, vouchsafe me,--


PRINCESS

Was not that Hector?


DUMAIN

The worthy knight of Troy.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

I will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave. I am
a votary; I have vowed to Jaquenetta to hold the
plough for her sweet love three years. But, most
esteemed greatness, will you hear the dialogue that
the two learned men have compiled in praise of the
owl and the cuckoo? It should have followed in the
end of our show.


FERDINAND

Call them forth quickly; we will do so.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

Holla! approach.
Re-enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, MOTH, COSTARD, and others
This side is Hiems, Winter, this Ver, the Spring;
the one maintained by the owl, the other by the
cuckoo. Ver, begin.
THE SONG
SPRING.
When daisies pied and violets blue
And lady-smocks all silver-white
And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue
Do paint the meadows with delight,
The cuckoo then, on every tree,
Mocks married men; for thus sings he, 	Cuckoo;
Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,
Unpleasing to a married ear!
When shepherds pipe on oaten straws
And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks,
When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws,
And maidens bleach their summer smocks
The cuckoo then, on every tree,
Mocks married men; for thus sings he, 	Cuckoo;
Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,
Unpleasing to a married ear!
WINTER.
When icicles hang by the wall
And Dick the shepherd blows his nail
And Tom bears logs into the hall
And milk comes frozen home in pail,
When blood is nipp'd and ways be foul,
Then nightly sings the staring owl, 	Tu-whit;
Tu-who, a merry note,
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
When all aloud the wind doth blow
And coughing drowns the parson's saw
And birds sit brooding in the snow
And Marian's nose looks red and raw,
When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,
Then nightly sings the staring owl, 	Tu-whit;
Tu-who, a merry note,
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
DON


ADRIANO DE ARMADO

The words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of
Apollo. You that way: we this way.

The Tragedy of Macbeth

ACT I
SCENE I. A desert place.

Thunder and lightning. Enter three Witches


First Witch

When shall we three meet again
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?


Second Witch

When the hurlyburly's done,
When the battle's lost and won.


Third Witch

That will be ere the set of sun.


First Witch

Where the place?


Second Witch

                  Upon the heath.


Third Witch

There to meet with Macbeth.


First Witch

I come, Graymalkin!


Second Witch

Paddock calls.


Third Witch

Anon.


ALL

Fair is foul, and foul is fair:
Hover through the fog and filthy air.
Exeunt

SCENE II. A camp near Forres.

Alarum within. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, LENNOX, with Attendants, meeting a bleeding Sergeant


DUNCAN

What bloody man is that? He can report,
As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
The newest state.


MALCOLM

                  This is the sergeant
Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!
Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
As thou didst leave it.


Sergeant

Doubtful it stood;
As two spent swimmers, that do cling together
And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald--
Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
The multiplying villanies of nature
Do swarm upon him--from the western isles
Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour's minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;
Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,
And fix'd his head upon our battlements.


DUNCAN

O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!


Sergeant

As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,
So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:
No sooner justice had with valour arm'd
Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,
With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men
Began a fresh assault.


DUNCAN

Dismay'd not this
Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?


Sergeant

Yes;
As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
If I say sooth, I must report they were
As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they
Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,
Or memorise another Golgotha,
I cannot tell.
But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.


DUNCAN

So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;
They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.
Exit Sergeant, attended
Who comes here?
Enter ROSS


MALCOLM

                  The worthy thane of Ross.


LENNOX

What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look
That seems to speak things strange.


ROSS

God save the king!


DUNCAN

Whence camest thou, worthy thane?


ROSS

From Fife, great king;
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
And fan our people cold. Norway himself,
With terrible numbers,
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;
Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,
Confronted him with self-comparisons,
Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.
Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,
The victory fell on us.


DUNCAN

Great happiness!


ROSS

That now
Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:
Nor would we deign him burial of his men
Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch
Ten thousand dollars to our general use.


DUNCAN

No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive
Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,
And with his former title greet Macbeth.


ROSS

I'll see it done.


DUNCAN

What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.
Exeunt

SCENE III. A heath near Forres.

Thunder. Enter the three Witches


First Witch

Where hast thou been, sister?


Second Witch

Killing swine.


Third Witch

Sister, where thou?


First Witch

A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,
And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:--
'Give me,' quoth I:
'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.
Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger:
But in a sieve I'll thither sail,
And, like a rat without a tail,
I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.


Second Witch

I'll give thee a wind.


First Witch

Thou'rt kind.


Third Witch

And I another.


First Witch

I myself have all the other,
And the very ports they blow,
All the quarters that they know
I' the shipman's card.
I will drain him dry as hay:
Sleep shall neither night nor day
Hang upon his pent-house lid;
He shall live a man forbid:
Weary se'nnights nine times nine
Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:
Though his bark cannot be lost,
Yet it shall be tempest-tost.
Look what I have.


Second Witch

Show me, show me.


First Witch

Here I have a pilot's thumb,
Wreck'd as homeward he did come.
Drum within


Third Witch

A drum, a drum!
Macbeth doth come.


ALL

The weird sisters, hand in hand,
Posters of the sea and land,
Thus do go about, about:
Thrice to thine and thrice to mine
And thrice again, to make up nine.
Peace! the charm's wound up.
Enter MACBETH and BANQUO


MACBETH

So foul and fair a day I have not seen.


BANQUO

How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these
So wither'd and so wild in their attire,
That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,
And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught
That man may question? You seem to understand me,
By each at once her chappy finger laying
Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
That you are so.


MACBETH

                  Speak, if you can: what are you?


First Witch

All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!


Second Witch

All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!


Third Witch

All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!


BANQUO

Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear
Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,
Are ye fantastical, or that indeed
Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner
You greet with present grace and great prediction
Of noble having and of royal hope,
That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.
If you can look into the seeds of time,
And say which grain will grow and which will not,
Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
Your favours nor your hate.


First Witch

Hail!


Second Witch

Hail!


Third Witch

Hail!


First Witch

Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.


Second Witch

Not so happy, yet much happier.


Third Witch

Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!


First Witch

Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!


MACBETH

Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:
By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;
But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,
A prosperous gentleman; and to be king
Stands not within the prospect of belief,
No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
You owe this strange intelligence? or why
Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.
Witches vanish


BANQUO

The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,
And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?


MACBETH

Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted
As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!


BANQUO

Were such things here as we do speak about?
Or have we eaten on the insane root
That takes the reason prisoner?


MACBETH

Your children shall be kings.


BANQUO

You shall be king.


MACBETH

And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?


BANQUO

To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?
Enter ROSS and ANGUS


ROSS

The king hath happily received, Macbeth,
The news of thy success; and when he reads
Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,
His wonders and his praises do contend
Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,
In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,
He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
Strange images of death. As thick as hail
Came post with post; and every one did bear
Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,
And pour'd them down before him.


ANGUS

We are sent
To give thee from our royal master thanks;
Only to herald thee into his sight,
Not pay thee.


ROSS

And, for an earnest of a greater honour,
He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor:
In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!
For it is thine.


BANQUO

                  What, can the devil speak true?


MACBETH

The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me
In borrow'd robes?


ANGUS

                  Who was the thane lives yet;
But under heavy judgment bears that life
Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined
With those of Norway, or did line the rebel
With hidden help and vantage, or that with both
He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;
But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,
Have overthrown him.


MACBETH

[Aside]  Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!
The greatest is behind.
To ROSS and ANGUS
Thanks for your pains.
To BANQUO
Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me
Promised no less to them?


BANQUO

That trusted home
Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
Win us with honest trifles, to betray's
In deepest consequence.
Cousins, a word, I pray you.


MACBETH

[Aside]	Two truths are told,
As happy prologues to the swelling act
Of the imperial theme.--I thank you, gentlemen.
Aside
Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,
Why hath it given me earnest of success,
Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:
If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
Against the use of nature? Present fears
Are less than horrible imaginings:
My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,
Shakes so my single state of man that function
Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is
But what is not.


BANQUO

                  Look, how our partner's rapt.


MACBETH

[Aside]  If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,
Without my stir.


BANQUO

                  New horrors come upon him,
Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould
But with the aid of use.


MACBETH

[Aside]                Come what come may,
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.


BANQUO

Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.


MACBETH

Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought
With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains
Are register'd where every day I turn
The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.
Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,
The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak
Our free hearts each to other.


BANQUO

Very gladly.


MACBETH

Till then, enough. Come, friends.
Exeunt

SCENE IV. Forres. The palace.

Flourish. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, LENNOX, and Attendants


DUNCAN

Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not
Those in commission yet return'd?


MALCOLM

My liege,
They are not yet come back. But I have spoke
With one that saw him die: who did report
That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,
Implored your highness' pardon and set forth
A deep repentance: nothing in his life
Became him like the leaving it; he died
As one that had been studied in his death
To throw away the dearest thing he owed,
As 'twere a careless trifle.


DUNCAN

There's no art
To find the mind's construction in the face:
He was a gentleman on whom I built
An absolute trust.
Enter MACBETH, BANQUO, ROSS, and ANGUS
O worthiest cousin!
The sin of my ingratitude even now
Was heavy on me: thou art so far before
That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,
That the proportion both of thanks and payment
Might have been mine! only I have left to say,
More is thy due than more than all can pay.


MACBETH

The service and the loyalty I owe,
In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' part
Is to receive our duties; and our duties
Are to your throne and state children and servants,
Which do but what they should, by doing every thing
Safe toward your love and honour.


DUNCAN

Welcome hither:
I have begun to plant thee, and will labour
To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,
That hast no less deserved, nor must be known
No less to have done so, let me enfold thee
And hold thee to my heart.


BANQUO

There if I grow,
The harvest is your own.


DUNCAN

My plenteous joys,
Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves
In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,
And you whose places are the nearest, know
We will establish our estate upon
Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter
The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must
Not unaccompanied invest him only,
But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine
On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,
And bind us further to you.


MACBETH

The rest is labour, which is not used for you:
I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful
The hearing of my wife with your approach;
So humbly take my leave.


DUNCAN

My worthy Cawdor!


MACBETH

[Aside]  The Prince of Cumberland! that is a step
On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,
For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;
Let not light see my black and deep desires:
The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be,
Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.
Exit


DUNCAN

True, worthy Banquo; he is full so valiant,
And in his commendations I am fed;
It is a banquet to me. Let's after him,
Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:
It is a peerless kinsman.
Flourish. Exeunt

SCENE V. Inverness. Macbeth's castle.

Enter LADY MACBETH, reading a letter


LADY MACBETH

'They met me in the day of success: and I have
learned by the perfectest report, they have more in
them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire
to question them further, they made themselves air,
into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in
the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who
all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title,
before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred
me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that
shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver
thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou
mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being
ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it
to thy heart, and farewell.'
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be
What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;
It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;
Art not without ambition, but without
The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,
That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,
That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;
And that which rather thou dost fear to do
Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,
That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;
And chastise with the valour of my tongue
All that impedes thee from the golden round,
Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
To have thee crown'd withal.
Enter a Messenger
What is your tidings?


Messenger

The king comes here to-night.


LADY MACBETH

Thou'rt mad to say it:
Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,
Would have inform'd for preparation.


Messenger

So please you, it is true: our thane is coming:
One of my fellows had the speed of him,
Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
Than would make up his message.


LADY MACBETH

Give him tending;
He brings great news.
Exit Messenger
The raven himself is hoarse
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
Under my battlements. Come, you spirits
That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,
And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;
Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
That no compunctious visitings of nature
Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between
The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,
Wherever in your sightless substances
You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,
To cry 'Hold, hold!'
Enter MACBETH
Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!
Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!
Thy letters have transported me beyond
This ignorant present, and I feel now
The future in the instant.


MACBETH

My dearest love,
Duncan comes here to-night.


LADY MACBETH

And when goes hence?


MACBETH

To-morrow, as he purposes.


LADY MACBETH

O, never
Shall sun that morrow see!
Your face, my thane, is as a book where men
May read strange matters. To beguile the time,
Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,
Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,
But be the serpent under't. He that's coming
Must be provided for: and you shall put
This night's great business into my dispatch;
Which shall to all our nights and days to come
Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.


MACBETH

We will speak further.


LADY MACBETH

Only look up clear;
To alter favour ever is to fear:
Leave all the rest to me.
Exeunt

SCENE VI. Before Macbeth's castle.

Hautboys and torches. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM,  DONALBAIN, BANQUO, LENNOX, MACDUFF, ROSS, ANGUS, and Attendants


DUNCAN

This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air
Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
Unto our gentle senses.


BANQUO

This guest of summer,
The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath
Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,
Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:
Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed,
The air is delicate.
Enter LADY MACBETH


DUNCAN

See, see, our honour'd hostess!
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,
Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you
How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains,
And thank us for your trouble.


LADY MACBETH

All our service
In every point twice done and then done double
Were poor and single business to contend
Against those honours deep and broad wherewith
Your majesty loads our house: for those of old,
And the late dignities heap'd up to them,
We rest your hermits.


DUNCAN

Where's the thane of Cawdor?
We coursed him at the heels, and had a purpose
To be his purveyor: but he rides well;
And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him
To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,
We are your guest to-night.


LADY MACBETH

Your servants ever
Have theirs, themselves and what is theirs, in compt,
To make their audit at your highness' pleasure,
Still to return your own.


DUNCAN

Give me your hand;
Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly,
And shall continue our graces towards him.
By your leave, hostess.
Exeunt

SCENE VII. Macbeth's castle.

Hautboys and torches. Enter a Sewer, and divers  Servants with dishes and service, and pass over the stage. Then enter MACBETH


MACBETH

If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well
It were done quickly: if the assassination
Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
With his surcease success; that but this blow
Might be the be-all and the end-all here,
But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases
We still have judgment here; that we but teach
Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return
To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice
Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
To our own lips. He's here in double trust;
First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
Who should against his murderer shut the door,
Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
So clear in his great office, that his virtues
Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against
The deep damnation of his taking-off;
And pity, like a naked new-born babe,
Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed
Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
To prick the sides of my intent, but only
Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself
And falls on the other.
Enter LADY MACBETH
How now! what news?


LADY MACBETH

He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?


MACBETH

Hath he ask'd for me?


LADY MACBETH

Know you not he has?


MACBETH

We will proceed no further in this business:
He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought
Golden opinions from all sorts of people,
Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,
Not cast aside so soon.


LADY MACBETH

Was the hope drunk
Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?
And wakes it now, to look so green and pale
At what it did so freely? From this time
Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard
To be the same in thine own act and valour
As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that
Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,
And live a coward in thine own esteem,
Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'
Like the poor cat i' the adage?


MACBETH

Prithee, peace:
I dare do all that may become a man;
Who dares do more is none.


LADY MACBETH

What beast was't, then,
That made you break this enterprise to me?
When you durst do it, then you were a man;
And, to be more than what you were, you would
Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place
Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
They have made themselves, and that their fitness now
Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know
How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:
I would, while it was smiling in my face,
Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,
And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you
Have done to this.


MACBETH

                  If we should fail?


LADY MACBETH

We fail!
But screw your courage to the sticking-place,
And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep--
Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey
Soundly invite him--his two chamberlains
Will I with wine and wassail so convince
That memory, the warder of the brain,
Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason
A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep
Their drenched natures lie as in a death,
What cannot you and I perform upon
The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon
His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt
Of our great quell?


MACBETH

Bring forth men-children only;
For thy undaunted mettle should compose
Nothing but males. Will it not be received,
When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two
Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,
That they have done't?


LADY MACBETH

Who dares receive it other,
As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar
Upon his death?


MACBETH

                  I am settled, and bend up
Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
Away, and mock the time with fairest show:
False face must hide what the false heart doth know.
Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. Court of Macbeth's castle.

Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE bearing a torch before him


BANQUO

How goes the night, boy?


FLEANCE

The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.


BANQUO

And she goes down at twelve.


FLEANCE

I take't, 'tis later, sir.


BANQUO

Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven;
Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers,
Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
Gives way to in repose!
Enter MACBETH, and a Servant with a torch
Give me my sword.
Who's there?


MACBETH

A friend.


BANQUO

What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:
He hath been in unusual pleasure, and
Sent forth great largess to your offices.
This diamond he greets your wife withal,
By the name of most kind hostess; and shut up
In measureless content.


MACBETH

Being unprepared,
Our will became the servant to defect;
Which else should free have wrought.


BANQUO

All's well.
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:
To you they have show'd some truth.


MACBETH

I think not of them:
Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,
We would spend it in some words upon that business,
If you would grant the time.


BANQUO

At your kind'st leisure.


MACBETH

If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,
It shall make honour for you.


BANQUO

So I lose none
In seeking to augment it, but still keep
My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,
I shall be counsell'd.


MACBETH

Good repose the while!


BANQUO

Thanks, sir: the like to you!
Exeunt BANQUO and FLEANCE


MACBETH

Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,
She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.
Exit Servant
Is this a dagger which I see before me,
The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
I see thee yet, in form as palpable
As this which now I draw.
Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;
And such an instrument I was to use.
Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,
Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,
And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,
Which was not so before. There's no such thing:
It is the bloody business which informs
Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld
Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates
Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,
Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,
Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.
With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design
Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,
Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,
And take the present horror from the time,
Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:
Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
A bell rings
I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.
Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell
That summons thee to heaven or to hell.
Exit

SCENE II. The same.

Enter LADY MACBETH


LADY MACBETH

That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;
What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.
Hark! Peace!
It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,
Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it:
The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms
Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd
their possets,
That death and nature do contend about them,
Whether they live or die.


MACBETH

[Within]  Who's there? what, ho!


LADY MACBETH

Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,
And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed
Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;
He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled
My father as he slept, I had done't.
Enter MACBETH
My husband!


MACBETH

I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?


LADY MACBETH

I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
Did not you speak?


MACBETH

                  When?


LADY MACBETH

Now.


MACBETH

As I descended?


LADY MACBETH

Ay.


MACBETH

Hark!
Who lies i' the second chamber?


LADY MACBETH

Donalbain.


MACBETH

This is a sorry sight.
Looking on his hands


LADY MACBETH

A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.


MACBETH

There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried
'Murder!'
That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them:
But they did say their prayers, and address'd them
Again to sleep.


LADY MACBETH

                  There are two lodged together.


MACBETH

One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other;
As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.
Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'
When they did say 'God bless us!'


LADY MACBETH

Consider it not so deeply.


MACBETH

But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?
I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'
Stuck in my throat.


LADY MACBETH

These deeds must not be thought
After these ways; so, it will make us mad.


MACBETH

Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!
Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep,
Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care,
The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,
Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,
Chief nourisher in life's feast,--


LADY MACBETH

What do you mean?


MACBETH

Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house:
'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor
Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.'


LADY MACBETH

Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,
You do unbend your noble strength, to think
So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,
And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
They must lie there: go carry them; and smear
The sleepy grooms with blood.


MACBETH

I'll go no more:
I am afraid to think what I have done;
Look on't again I dare not.


LADY MACBETH

Infirm of purpose!
Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead
Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood
That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,
I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;
For it must seem their guilt.
Exit. Knocking within


MACBETH

Whence is that knocking?
How is't with me, when every noise appals me?
What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes.
Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood
Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather
The multitudinous seas in incarnadine,
Making the green one red.
Re-enter LADY MACBETH


LADY MACBETH

My hands are of your colour; but I shame
To wear a heart so white.
Knocking within
I hear a knocking
At the south entry: retire we to our chamber;
A little water clears us of this deed:
How easy is it, then! Your constancy
Hath left you unattended.
Knocking within
Hark! more knocking.
Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us,
And show us to be watchers. Be not lost
So poorly in your thoughts.


MACBETH

To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.
Knocking within
Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!
Exeunt

SCENE III. The same.

Knocking within. Enter a Porter


Porter

Here's a knocking indeed! If a
man were porter of hell-gate, he should have
old turning the key.
Knocking within
Knock,
knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of
Beelzebub? Here's a farmer, that hanged
himself on the expectation of plenty: come in
time; have napkins enow about you; here
you'll sweat for't.
Knocking within
Knock,
knock! Who's there, in the other devil's
name? Faith, here's an equivocator, that could
swear in both the scales against either scale;
who committed treason enough for God's sake,
yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come
in, equivocator.
Knocking within
Knock,
knock, knock! Who's there? Faith, here's an
English tailor come hither, for stealing out of
a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may
roast your goose.
Knocking within
Knock,
knock; never at quiet! What are you? But
this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter
it no further: I had thought to have let in
some of all professions that go the primrose
way to the everlasting bonfire.
Knocking within
Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter.
Opens the gate
Enter MACDUFF and LENNOX


MACDUFF

Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,
That you do lie so late?


Porter

'Faith sir, we were carousing till the
second cock: and drink, sir, is a great
provoker of three things.


MACDUFF

What three things does drink especially provoke?


Porter

Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and
urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes;
it provokes the desire, but it takes
away the performance: therefore, much drink
may be said to be an equivocator with lechery:
it makes him, and it mars him; it sets
him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him,
and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and
not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him
in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.


MACDUFF

I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.


Porter

That it did, sir, i' the very throat on
me: but I requited him for his lie; and, I
think, being too strong for him, though he took
up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast
him.


MACDUFF

Is thy master stirring?
Enter MACBETH
Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.


LENNOX

Good morrow, noble sir.


MACBETH

Good morrow, both.


MACDUFF

Is the king stirring, worthy thane?


MACBETH

Not yet.


MACDUFF

He did command me to call timely on him:
I have almost slipp'd the hour.


MACBETH

I'll bring you to him.


MACDUFF

I know this is a joyful trouble to you;
But yet 'tis one.


MACBETH

The labour we delight in physics pain.
This is the door.


MACDUFF

                  I'll make so bold to call,
For 'tis my limited service.
Exit


LENNOX

Goes the king hence to-day?


MACBETH

He does: he did appoint so.


LENNOX

The night has been unruly: where we lay,
Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,
Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death,
And prophesying with accents terrible
Of dire combustion and confused events
New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird
Clamour'd the livelong night: some say, the earth
Was feverous and did shake.


MACBETH

'Twas a rough night.


LENNOX

My young remembrance cannot parallel
A fellow to it.
Re-enter MACDUFF


MACDUFF

O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart
Cannot conceive nor name thee!


MACBETH

LENNOX

What's the matter.


MACDUFF

Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!
Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence
The life o' the building!


MACBETH

What is 't you say? the life?


LENNOX

Mean you his majesty?


MACDUFF

Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight
With a new Gorgon: do not bid me speak;
See, and then speak yourselves.
Exeunt MACBETH and LENNOX
Awake, awake!
Ring the alarum-bell. Murder and treason!
Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!
Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,
And look on death itself! up, up, and see
The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo!
As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites,
To countenance this horror! Ring the bell.
Bell rings
Enter LADY MACBETH


LADY MACBETH

What's the business,
That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
The sleepers of the house? speak, speak!


MACDUFF

O gentle lady,
'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:
The repetition, in a woman's ear,
Would murder as it fell.
Enter BANQUO
O Banquo, Banquo,
Our royal master 's murder'd!


LADY MACBETH

Woe, alas!
What, in our house?


BANQUO

Too cruel any where.
Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,
And say it is not so.
Re-enter MACBETH and LENNOX, with ROSS


MACBETH

Had I but died an hour before this chance,
I had lived a blessed time; for, from this instant,
There 's nothing serious in mortality:
All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;
The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees
Is left this vault to brag of.
Enter MALCOLM and DONALBAIN


DONALBAIN

What is amiss?


MACBETH

                  You are, and do not know't:
The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood
Is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd.


MACDUFF

Your royal father 's murder'd.


MALCOLM

O, by whom?


LENNOX

Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't:
Their hands and faces were an badged with blood;
So were their daggers, which unwiped we found
Upon their pillows:
They stared, and were distracted; no man's life
Was to be trusted with them.


MACBETH

O, yet I do repent me of my fury,
That I did kill them.


MACDUFF

Wherefore did you so?


MACBETH

Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,
Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:
The expedition my violent love
Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,
His silver skin laced with his golden blood;
And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature
For ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,
Steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers
Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain,
That had a heart to love, and in that heart
Courage to make 's love kno wn?


LADY MACBETH

Help me hence, ho!


MACDUFF

Look to the lady.


MALCOLM

[Aside to DONALBAIN]  Why do we hold our tongues,
That most may claim this argument for ours?


DONALBAIN

[Aside to MALCOLM]  What should be spoken here,
where our fate,
Hid in an auger-hole, may rush, and seize us?
Let 's away;
Our tears are not yet brew'd.


MALCOLM

[Aside to DONALBAIN]        Nor our strong sorrow
Upon the foot of motion.


BANQUO

Look to the lady:
LADY MACBETH is carried out
And when we have our naked frailties hid,
That suffer in exposure, let us meet,
And question this most bloody piece of work,
To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:
In the great hand of God I stand; and thence
Against the undivulged pretence I fight
Of treasonous malice.


MACDUFF

And so do I.


ALL

So all.


MACBETH

Let's briefly put on manly readiness,
And meet i' the hall together.


ALL

Well contented.
Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain.


MALCOLM

What will you do? Let's not consort with them:
To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.


DONALBAIN

To Ireland, I; our separated fortune
Shall keep us both the safer: where we are,
There's daggers in men's smiles: the near in blood,
The nearer bloody.


MALCOLM

                  This murderous shaft that's shot
Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way
Is to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse;
And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,
But shift away: there's warrant in that theft
Which steals itself, when there's no mercy left.
Exeunt

SCENE IV. Outside Macbeth's castle.

Enter ROSS and an old Man


Old Man

Threescore and ten I can remember well:
Within the volume of which time I have seen
Hours dreadful and things strange; but this sore night
Hath trifled former knowings.


ROSS

Ah, good father,
Thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's act,
Threaten his bloody stage: by the clock, 'tis day,
And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp:
Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame,
That darkness does the face of earth entomb,
When living light should kiss it?


Old Man

'Tis unnatural,
Even like the deed that's done. On Tuesday last,
A falcon, towering in her pride of place,
Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.


ROSS

And Duncan's horses--a thing most strange and certain--
Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,
Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,
Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would make
War with mankind.


Old Man

'Tis said they eat each other.


ROSS

They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes
That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.
Enter MACDUFF
How goes the world, sir, now?


MACDUFF

Why, see you not?


ROSS

Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?


MACDUFF

Those that Macbeth hath slain.


ROSS

Alas, the day!
What good could they pretend?


MACDUFF

They were suborn'd:
Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,
Are stol'n away and fled; which puts upon them
Suspicion of the deed.


ROSS

'Gainst nature still!
Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up
Thine own life's means! Then 'tis most like
The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.


MACDUFF

He is already named, and gone to Scone
To be invested.


ROSS

                  Where is Duncan's body?


MACDUFF

Carried to Colmekill,
The sacred storehouse of his predecessors,
And guardian of their bones.


ROSS

Will you to Scone?


MACDUFF

No, cousin, I'll to Fife.


ROSS

Well, I will thither.


MACDUFF

Well, may you see things well done there: adieu!
Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!


ROSS

Farewell, father.


Old Man

God's benison go with you; and with those
That would make good of bad, and friends of foes!
Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. Forres. The palace.

Enter BANQUO


BANQUO

Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,
As the weird women promised, and, I fear,
Thou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was said
It should not stand in thy posterity,
But that myself should be the root and father
Of many kings. If there come truth from them--
As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine--
Why, by the verities on thee made good,
May they not be my oracles as well,
And set me up in hope? But hush! no more.
Sennet sounded. Enter MACBETH, as king, LADY  MACBETH, as queen, LENNOX, ROSS, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants


MACBETH

Here's our chief guest.


LADY MACBETH

If he had been forgotten,
It had been as a gap in our great feast,
And all-thing unbecoming.


MACBETH

To-night we hold a solemn supper sir,
And I'll request your presence.


BANQUO

Let your highness
Command upon me; to the which my duties
Are with a most indissoluble tie
For ever knit.


MACBETH

                  Ride you this afternoon?


BANQUO

Ay, my good lord.


MACBETH

We should have else desired your good advice,
Which still hath been both grave and prosperous,
In this day's council; but we'll take to-morrow.
Is't far you ride?


BANQUO

As far, my lord, as will fill up the time
'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,
I must become a borrower of the night
For a dark hour or twain.


MACBETH

Fail not our feast.


BANQUO

My lord, I will not.


MACBETH

We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'd
In England and in Ireland, not confessing
Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers
With strange invention: but of that to-morrow,
When therewithal we shall have cause of state
Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu,
Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?


BANQUO

Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon 's.


MACBETH

I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;
And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell.
Exit BANQUO
Let every man be master of his time
Till seven at night: to make society
The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself
Till supper-time alone: while then, God be with you!
Exeunt all but MACBETH, and an attendant
Sirrah, a word with you: attend those men
Our pleasure?


ATTENDANT

They are, my lord, without the palace gate.


MACBETH

Bring them before us.
Exit Attendant
To be thus is nothing;
But to be safely thus.--Our fears in Banquo
Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature
Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
To act in safety. There is none but he
Whose being I do fear: and, under him,
My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,
Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
When first they put the name of king upon me,
And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like
They hail'd him father to a line of kings:
Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,
And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,
For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;
For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;
Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
Only for them; and mine eternal jewel
Given to the common enemy of man,
To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!
Rather than so, come fate into the list.
And champion me to the utterance! Who's there!
Re-enter Attendant, with two Murderers
Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.
Exit Attendant
Was it not yesterday we spoke together?


First Murderer

It was, so please your highness.


MACBETH

Well then, now
Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know
That it was he in the times past which held you
So under fortune, which you thought had been
Our innocent self: this I made good to you
In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,
How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,
the instruments,
Who wrought with them, and all things else that might
To half a soul and to a notion crazed
Say 'Thus did Banquo.'


First Murderer

You made it known to us.


MACBETH

I did so, and went further, which is now
Our point of second meeting. Do you find
Your patience so predominant in your nature
That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd
To pray for this good man and for his issue,
Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave
And beggar'd yours for ever?


First Murderer

We are men, my liege.


MACBETH

Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;
As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,
Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept
All by the name of dogs: the valued file
Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,
The housekeeper, the hunter, every one
According to the gift which bounteous nature
Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive
Particular addition. from the bill
That writes them all alike: and so of men.
Now, if you have a station in the file,
Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't;
And I will put that business in your bosoms,
Whose execution takes your enemy off,
Grapples you to the heart and love of us,
Who wear our health but sickly in his life,
Which in his death were perfect.


Second Murderer

I am one, my liege,
Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
Have so incensed that I am reckless what
I do to spite the world.


First Murderer

And I another
So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,
That I would set my lie on any chance,
To mend it, or be rid on't.


MACBETH

Both of you
Know Banquo was your enemy.


Both Murderers

True, my lord.


MACBETH

So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,
That every minute of his being thrusts
Against my near'st of life: and though I could
With barefaced power sweep him from my sight
And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,
For certain friends that are both his and mine,
Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall
Who I myself struck down; and thence it is,
That I to your assistance do make love,
Masking the business from the common eye
For sundry weighty reasons.


Second Murderer

We shall, my lord,
Perform what you command us.


First Murderer

Though our lives--


MACBETH

Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most
I will advise you where to plant yourselves;
Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,
The moment on't; for't must be done to-night,
And something from the palace; always thought
That I require a clearness: and with him--
To leave no rubs nor botches in the work--
Fleance his son, that keeps him company,
Whose absence is no less material to me
Than is his father's, must embrace the fate
Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:
I'll come to you anon.


Both Murderers

We are resolved, my lord.


MACBETH

I'll call upon you straight: abide within.
Exeunt Murderers
It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight,
If it find heaven, must find it out to-night.
Exit

SCENE II. The palace.

Enter LADY MACBETH and a Servant


LADY MACBETH

Is Banquo gone from court?


Servant

Ay, madam, but returns again to-night.


LADY MACBETH

Say to the king, I would attend his leisure
For a few words.


Servant

                  Madam, I will.
Exit


LADY MACBETH

Nought's had, all's spent,
Where our desire is got without content:
'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.
Enter MACBETH
How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,
Of sorriest fancies your companions making,
Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
With them they think on? Things without all remedy
Should be without regard: what's done is done.


MACBETH

We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:
She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice
Remains in danger of her former tooth.
But let the frame of things disjoint, both the
worlds suffer,
Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
In the affliction of these terrible dreams
That shake us nightly: better be with the dead,
Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,
Than on the torture of the mind to lie
In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;
After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;
Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,
Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
Can touch him further.


LADY MACBETH

Come on;
Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;
Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.


MACBETH

So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you:
Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;
Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:
Unsafe the while, that we
Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,
And make our faces vizards to our hearts,
Disguising what they are.


LADY MACBETH

You must leave this.


MACBETH

O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!
Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.


LADY MACBETH

But in them nature's copy's not eterne.


MACBETH

There's comfort yet; they are assailable;
Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown
His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons
The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums
Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done
A deed of dreadful note.


LADY MACBETH

What's to be done?


MACBETH

Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;
And with thy bloody and invisible hand
Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow
Makes wing to the rooky wood:
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;
While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.
Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;
Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
So, prithee, go with me.
Exeunt

SCENE III. A park near the palace.

Enter three Murderers


First Murderer

But who did bid thee join with us?


Third Murderer

Macbeth.


Second Murderer

He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers
Our offices and what we have to do
To the direction just.


First Murderer

Then stand with us.
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day:
Now spurs the lated traveller apace
To gain the timely inn; and near approaches
The subject of our watch.


Third Murderer

Hark! I hear horses.


BANQUO

[Within]  Give us a light there, ho!


Second Murderer

Then 'tis he: the rest
That are within the note of expectation
Already are i' the court.


First Murderer

His horses go about.


Third Murderer

Almost a mile: but he does usually,
So all men do, from hence to the palace gate
Make it their walk.


Second Murderer

A light, a light!
Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE with a torch


Third Murderer

'Tis he.


First Murderer

Stand to't.


BANQUO

It will be rain to-night.


First Murderer

Let it come down.
They set upon BANQUO


BANQUO

O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
Thou mayst revenge. O slave!
Dies. FLEANCE escapes


Third Murderer

Who did strike out the light?


First Murderer

Wast not the way?


Third Murderer

There's but one down; the son is fled.


Second Murderer

We have lost
Best half of our affair.


First Murderer

Well, let's away, and say how much is done.
Exeunt

SCENE IV. The same. Hall in the palace.

A banquet prepared. Enter MACBETH, LADY MACBETH, ROSS, LENNOX, Lords, and Attendants


MACBETH

You know your own degrees; sit down: at first
And last the hearty welcome.


Lords

Thanks to your majesty.


MACBETH

Ourself will mingle with society,
And play the humble host.
Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time
We will require her welcome.


LADY MACBETH

Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;
For my heart speaks they are welcome.
First Murderer appears at the door


MACBETH

See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.
Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst:
Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure
The table round.
Approaching the door
There's blood on thy face.


First Murderer

'Tis Banquo's then.


MACBETH

'Tis better thee without than he within.
Is he dispatch'd?


First Murderer

My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.


MACBETH

Thou art the best o' the cut-throats: yet he's good
That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it,
Thou art the nonpareil.


First Murderer

Most royal sir,
Fleance is 'scaped.


MACBETH

Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect,
Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,
As broad and general as the casing air:
But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in
To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe?


First Murderer

Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides,
With twenty trenched gashes on his head;
The least a death to nature.


MACBETH

Thanks for that:
There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled
Hath nature that in time will venom breed,
No teeth for the present. Get thee gone: to-morrow
We'll hear, ourselves, again.
Exit Murderer


LADY MACBETH

My royal lord,
You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold
That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making,
'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home;
From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;
Meeting were bare without it.


MACBETH

Sweet remembrancer!
Now, good digestion wait on appetite,
And health on both!


LENNOX

May't please your highness sit.
The GHOST OF BANQUO enters, and sits in MACBETH's place


MACBETH

Here had we now our country's honour roof'd,
Were the graced person of our Banquo present;
Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
Than pity for mischance!


ROSS

His absence, sir,
Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your highness
To grace us with your royal company.


MACBETH

The table's full.


LENNOX

                  Here is a place reserved, sir.


MACBETH

Where?


LENNOX

Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your highness?


MACBETH

Which of you have done this?


Lords

What, my good lord?


MACBETH

Thou canst not say I did it: never shake
Thy gory locks at me.


ROSS

Gentlemen, rise: his highness is not well.


LADY MACBETH

Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,
And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;
The fit is momentary; upon a thought
He will again be well: if much you note him,
You shall offend him and extend his passion:
Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?


MACBETH

Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that
Which might appal the devil.


LADY MACBETH

O proper stuff!
This is the very painting of your fear:
This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,
Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,
Impostors to true fear, would well become
A woman's story at a winter's fire,
Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!
Why do you make such faces? When all's done,
You look but on a stool.


MACBETH

Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo!
how say you?
Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.
If charnel-houses and our graves must send
Those that we bury back, our monuments
Shall be the maws of kites.
GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes


LADY MACBETH

What, quite unmann'd in folly?


MACBETH

If I stand here, I saw him.


LADY MACBETH

Fie, for shame!


MACBETH

Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,
Ere human statute purged the gentle weal;
Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd
Too terrible for the ear: the times have been,
That, when the brains were out, the man would die,
And there an end; but now they rise again,
With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,
And push us from our stools: this is more strange
Than such a murder is.


LADY MACBETH

My worthy lord,
Your noble friends do lack you.


MACBETH

I do forget.
Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,
I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing
To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;
Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.
I drink to the general joy o' the whole table,
And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss;
Would he were here! to all, and him, we thirst,
And all to all.


Lords

                  Our duties, and the pledge.
Re-enter GHOST OF BANQUO


MACBETH

Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!
Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
Which thou dost glare with!


LADY MACBETH

Think of this, good peers,
But as a thing of custom: 'tis no other;
Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.


MACBETH

What man dare, I dare:
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,
The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;
Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves
Shall never tremble: or be alive again,
And dare me to the desert with thy sword;
If trembling I inhabit then, protest me
The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!
Unreal mockery, hence!
GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes
Why, so: being gone,
I am a man again. Pray you, sit still.


LADY MACBETH

You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting,
With most admired disorder.


MACBETH

Can such things be,
And overcome us like a summer's cloud,
Without our special wonder? You make me strange
Even to the disposition that I owe,
When now I think you can behold such sights,
And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,
When mine is blanched with fear.


ROSS

What sights, my lord?


LADY MACBETH

I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;
Question enrages him. At once, good night:
Stand not upon the order of your going,
But go at once.


LENNOX

                  Good night; and better health
Attend his majesty!


LADY MACBETH

A kind good night to all!
Exeunt all but MACBETH and LADY MACBETH


MACBETH

It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood:
Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;
Augurs and understood relations have
By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth
The secret'st man of blood. What is the night?


LADY MACBETH

Almost at odds with morning, which is which.


MACBETH

How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person
At our great bidding?


LADY MACBETH

Did you send to him, sir?


MACBETH

I hear it by the way; but I will send:
There's not a one of them but in his house
I keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow,
And betimes I will, to the weird sisters:
More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,
By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,
All causes shall give way: I am in blood
Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,
Returning were as tedious as go o'er:
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand;
Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.


LADY MACBETH

You lack the season of all natures, sleep.


MACBETH

Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse
Is the initiate fear that wants hard use:
We are yet but young in deed.
Exeunt

SCENE V. A Heath.

Thunder. Enter the three Witches meeting HECATE


First Witch

Why, how now, Hecate! you look angerly.


HECATE

Have I not reason, beldams as you are,
Saucy and overbold? How did you dare
To trade and traffic with Macbeth
In riddles and affairs of death;
And I, the mistress of your charms,
The close contriver of all harms,
Was never call'd to bear my part,
Or show the glory of our art?
And, which is worse, all you have done
Hath been but for a wayward son,
Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,
Loves for his own ends, not for you.
But make amends now: get you gone,
And at the pit of Acheron
Meet me i' the morning: thither he
Will come to know his destiny:
Your vessels and your spells provide,
Your charms and every thing beside.
I am for the air; this night I'll spend
Unto a dismal and a fatal end:
Great business must be wrought ere noon:
Upon the corner of the moon
There hangs a vaporous drop profound;
I'll catch it ere it come to ground:
And that distill'd by magic sleights
Shall raise such artificial sprites
As by the strength of their illusion
Shall draw him on to his confusion:
He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear
He hopes 'bove wisdom, grace and fear:
And you all know, security
Is mortals' chiefest enemy.
Music and a song within: 'Come away, come away,'  & c
Hark! I am call'd; my little spirit, see,
Sits in a foggy cloud, and stays for me.
Exit


First Witch

Come, let's make haste; she'll soon be back again.
Exeunt

SCENE VI. Forres. The palace.

Enter LENNOX and another Lord


LENNOX

My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,
Which can interpret further: only, I say,
Things have been strangely borne. The
gracious Duncan
Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:
And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;
Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,
For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.
Who cannot want the thought how monstrous
It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
To kill their gracious father? damned fact!
How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight
In pious rage the two delinquents tear,
That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;
For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive
To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,
He has borne all things well: and I do think
That had he Duncan's sons under his key--
As, an't please heaven, he shall not--they
should find
What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.
But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd
His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear
Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell
Where he bestows himself?


Lord

The son of Duncan,
From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth
Lives in the English court, and is received
Of the most pious Edward with such grace
That the malevolence of fortune nothing
Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff
Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid
To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:
That, by the help of these--with Him above
To ratify the work--we may again
Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,
Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,
Do faithful homage and receive free honours:
All which we pine for now: and this report
Hath so exasperate the king that he
Prepares for some attempt of war.


LENNOX

Sent he to Macduff?


Lord

He did: and with an absolute 'Sir, not I,'
The cloudy messenger turns me his back,
And hums, as who should say 'You'll rue the time
That clogs me with this answer.'


LENNOX

And that well might
Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance
His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel
Fly to the court of England and unfold
His message ere he come, that a swift blessing
May soon return to this our suffering country
Under a hand accursed!


Lord

I'll send my prayers with him.
Exeunt

ACT IV
SCENE I. A cavern. In the middle, a boiling cauldron.

Thunder. Enter the three Witches


First Witch

Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.


Second Witch

Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.


Third Witch

Harpier cries 'Tis time, 'tis time.


First Witch

Round about the cauldron go;
In the poison'd entrails throw.
Toad, that under cold stone
Days and nights has thirty-one
Swelter'd venom sleeping got,
Boil thou first i' the charmed pot.


ALL

Double, double toil and trouble;
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.


Second Witch

Fillet of a fenny snake,
In the cauldron boil and bake;
Eye of newt and toe of frog,
Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,
Lizard's leg and owlet's wing,
For a charm of powerful trouble,
Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.


ALL

Double, double toil and trouble;
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.


Third Witch

Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,
Witches' mummy, maw and gulf
Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark,
Root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark,
Liver of blaspheming Jew,
Gall of goat, and slips of yew
Silver'd in the moon's eclipse,
Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips,
Finger of birth-strangled babe
Ditch-deliver'd by a drab,
Make the gruel thick and slab:
Add thereto a tiger's chaudron,
For the ingredients of our cauldron.


ALL

Double, double toil and trouble;
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.


Second Witch

Cool it with a baboon's blood,
Then the charm is firm and good.
Enter HECATE to the other three Witches


HECATE

O well done! I commend your pains;
And every one shall share i' the gains;
And now about the cauldron sing,
Live elves and fairies in a ring,
Enchanting all that you put in.
Music and a song: 'Black spirits,'  & c
HECATE retires


Second Witch

By the pricking of my thumbs,
Something wicked this way comes.
Open, locks,
Whoever knocks!
Enter MACBETH


MACBETH

How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!
What is't you do?


ALL

                  A deed without a name.


MACBETH

I conjure you, by that which you profess,
Howe'er you come to know it, answer me:
Though you untie the winds and let them fight
Against the churches; though the yesty waves
Confound and swallow navigation up;
Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down;
Though castles topple on their warders' heads;
Though palaces and pyramids do slope
Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure
Of nature's germens tumble all together,
Even till destruction sicken; answer me
To what I ask you.


First Witch

                  Speak.


Second Witch

Demand.


Third Witch

We'll answer.


First Witch

Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths,
Or from our masters?


MACBETH

Call 'em; let me see 'em.


First Witch

Pour in sow's blood, that hath eaten
Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten
From the murderer's gibbet throw
Into the flame.


ALL

                  Come, high or low;
Thyself and office deftly show!
Thunder. First Apparition: an armed Head


MACBETH

Tell me, thou unknown power,--


First Witch

He knows thy thought:
Hear his speech, but say thou nought.


First Apparition

Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff;
Beware the thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.
Descends


MACBETH

Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;
Thou hast harp'd my fear aright: but one
word more,--


First Witch

He will not be commanded: here's another,
More potent than the first.
Thunder. Second Apparition: A bloody Child


Second Apparition

Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!


MACBETH

Had I three ears, I'ld hear thee.


Second Apparition

Be bloody, bold, and resolute; laugh to scorn
The power of man, for none of woman born
Shall harm Macbeth.
Descends


MACBETH

Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee?
But yet I'll make assurance double sure,
And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live;
That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,
And sleep in spite of thunder.
Thunder. Third Apparition: a Child crowned, with a tree in his hand
What is this
That rises like the issue of a king,
And wears upon his baby-brow the round
And top of sovereignty?


ALL

Listen, but speak not to't.


Third Apparition

Be lion-mettled, proud; and take no care
Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are:
Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until
Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill
Shall come against him.
Descends


MACBETH

That will never be
Who can impress the forest, bid the tree
Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements! good!
Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth
Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath
To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart
Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art
Can tell so much: shall Banquo's issue ever
Reign in this kingdom?


ALL

Seek to know no more.


MACBETH

I will be satisfied: deny me this,
And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.
Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this?
Hautboys


First Witch

Show!


Second Witch

Show!


Third Witch

Show!


ALL

Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;
Come like shadows, so depart!
A show of Eight Kings, the last with a glass in his hand; GHOST OF BANQUO following


MACBETH

Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo: down!
Thy crown does sear mine eye-balls. And thy hair,
Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.
A third is like the former. Filthy hags!
Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!
What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?
Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more:
And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass
Which shows me many more; and some I see
That two-fold balls and treble scepters carry:
Horrible sight! Now, I see, 'tis true;
For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me,
And points at them for his.
Apparitions vanish
What, is this so?


First Witch

Ay, sir, all this is so: but why
Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,
And show the best of our delights:
I'll charm the air to give a sound,
While you perform your antic round:
That this great king may kindly say,
Our duties did his welcome pay.
Music. The witches dance and then vanish, with HECATE


MACBETH

Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour
Stand aye accursed in the calendar!
Come in, without there!
Enter LENNOX


LENNOX

What's your grace's will?


MACBETH

Saw you the weird sisters?


LENNOX

No, my lord.


MACBETH

Came they not by you?


LENNOX

No, indeed, my lord.


MACBETH

Infected be the air whereon they ride;
And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear
The galloping of horse: who was't came by?


LENNOX

'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word
Macduff is fled to England.


MACBETH

Fled to England!


LENNOX

Ay, my good lord.


MACBETH

Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits:
The flighty purpose never is o'ertook
Unless the deed go with it; from this moment
The very firstlings of my heart shall be
The firstlings of my hand. And even now,
To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:
The castle of Macduff I will surprise;
Seize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword
His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls
That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;
This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.
But no more sights!--Where are these gentlemen?
Come, bring me where they are.
Exeunt

SCENE II. Fife. Macduff's castle.

Enter LADY MACDUFF, her Son, and ROSS


LADY MACDUFF

What had he done, to make him fly the land?


ROSS

You must have patience, madam.


LADY MACDUFF

He had none:
His flight was madness: when our actions do not,
Our fears do make us traitors.


ROSS

You know not
Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.


LADY MACDUFF

Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,
His mansion and his titles in a place
From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;
He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren,
The most diminutive of birds, will fight,
Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
All is the fear and nothing is the love;
As little is the wisdom, where the flight
So runs against all reason.


ROSS

My dearest coz,
I pray you, school yourself: but for your husband,
He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows
The fits o' the season. I dare not speak
much further;
But cruel are the times, when we are traitors
And do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour
From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,
But float upon a wild and violent sea
Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
Shall not be long but I'll be here again:
Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward
To what they were before. My pretty cousin,
Blessing upon you!


LADY MACDUFF

Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.


ROSS

I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,
It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:
I take my leave at once.
Exit


LADY MACDUFF

Sirrah, your father's dead;
And what will you do now? How will you live?


Son

As birds do, mother.


LADY MACDUFF

What, with worms and flies?


Son

With what I get, I mean; and so do they.


LADY MACDUFF

Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,
The pitfall nor the gin.


Son

Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for.
My father is not dead, for all your saying.


LADY MACDUFF

Yes, he is dead; how wilt thou do for a father?


Son

Nay, how will you do for a husband?


LADY MACDUFF

Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.


Son

Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.


LADY MACDUFF

Thou speak'st with all thy wit: and yet, i' faith,
With wit enough for thee.


Son

Was my father a traitor, mother?


LADY MACDUFF

Ay, that he was.


Son

What is a traitor?


LADY MACDUFF

Why, one that swears and lies.


Son

And be all traitors that do so?


LADY MACDUFF

Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged.


Son

And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?


LADY MACDUFF

Every one.


Son

Who must hang them?


LADY MACDUFF

Why,  the honest men.


Son

Then the liars and swearers are fools,
for there are liars and swearers enow to beat
the honest men and hang up them.


LADY MACDUFF

Now, God help thee, poor monkey!
But how wilt thou do for a father?


Son

If he were dead, you'ld weep for
him: if you would not, it were a good sign
that I should quickly have a new father.


LADY MACDUFF

Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!
Enter a Messenger


Messenger

Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,
Though in your state of honour I am perfect.
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:
If you will take a homely man's advice,
Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.
To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage;
To do worse to you were fell cruelty,
Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!
I dare abide no longer.
Exit


LADY MACDUFF

Whither should I fly?
I have done no harm. But I remember now
I am in this earthly world; where to do harm
Is often laudable, to do good sometime
Accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas,
Do I put up that womanly defence,
To say I have done no harm?
Enter Murderers
What are these faces?


First Murderer

Where is your husband?


LADY MACDUFF

I hope, in no place so unsanctified
Where such as thou mayst find him.


First Murderer

He's a traitor.


Son

Thou liest, thou shag-hair'd villain!


First Murderer

What, you egg!
Stabbing him
Young fry of treachery!


Son

He has kill'd me, mother:
Run away, I pray you!
Dies
Exit LADY MACDUFF, crying 'Murder!' Exeunt Murderers, following her

SCENE III. England. Before the King's palace.

Enter MALCOLM and MACDUFF


MALCOLM

Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there
Weep our sad bosoms empty.


MACDUFF

Let us rather
Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men
Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new morn
New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows
Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds
As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out
Like syllable of dolour.


MALCOLM

What I believe I'll wail,
What know believe, and what I can redress,
As I shall find the time to friend, I will.
What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.
This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
Was once thought honest: you have loved him well.
He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young;
but something
You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom
To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb
To appease an angry god.


MACDUFF

I am not treacherous.


MALCOLM

But Macbeth is.
A good and virtuous nature may recoil
In an imperial charge. But I shall crave
your pardon;
That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell;
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,
Yet grace must still look so.


MACDUFF

I have lost my hopes.


MALCOLM

Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
Why in that rawness left you wife and child,
Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,
Without leave-taking? I pray you,
Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,
But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,
Whatever I shall think.


MACDUFF

Bleed, bleed, poor country!
Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,
For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou
thy wrongs;
The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord:
I would not be the villain that thou think'st
For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,
And the rich East to boot.


MALCOLM

Be not offended:
I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;
It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash
Is added to her wounds: I think withal
There would be hands uplifted in my right;
And here from gracious England have I offer
Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,
When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,
Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country
Shall have more vices than it had before,
More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,
By him that shall succeed.


MACDUFF

What should he be?


MALCOLM

It is myself I mean: in whom I know
All the particulars of vice so grafted
That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth
Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state
Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
With my confineless harms.


MACDUFF

Not in the legions
Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd
In evils to top Macbeth.


MALCOLM

I grant him bloody,
Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,
Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin
That has a name: but there's no bottom, none,
In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,
Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up
The cistern of my lust, and my desire
All continent impediments would o'erbear
That did oppose my will: better Macbeth
Than such an one to reign.


MACDUFF

Boundless intemperance
In nature is a tyranny; it hath been
The untimely emptying of the happy throne
And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
To take upon you what is yours: you may
Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,
And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.
We have willing dames enough: there cannot be
That vulture in you, to devour so many
As will to greatness dedicate themselves,
Finding it so inclined.


MALCOLM

With this there grows
In my most ill-composed affection such
A stanchless avarice that, were I king,
I should cut off the nobles for their lands,
Desire his jewels and this other's house:
And my more-having would be as a sauce
To make me hunger more; that I should forge
Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,
Destroying them for wealth.


MACDUFF

This avarice
Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root
Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been
The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;
Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.
Of your mere own: all these are portable,
With other graces weigh'd.


MALCOLM

But I have none: the king-becoming graces,
As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,
Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,
Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,
I have no relish of them, but abound
In the division of each several crime,
Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should
Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,
Uproar the universal peace, confound
All unity on earth.


MACDUFF

O Scotland, Scotland!


MALCOLM

If such a one be fit to govern, speak:
I am as I have spoken.


MACDUFF

Fit to govern!
No, not to live. O nation miserable,
With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,
When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,
Since that the truest issue of thy throne
By his own interdiction stands accursed,
And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father
Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee,
Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,
Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!
These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself
Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,
Thy hope ends here!


MALCOLM

Macduff, this noble passion,
Child of integrity, hath from my soul
Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts
To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth
By many of these trains hath sought to win me
Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
From over-credulous haste: but God above
Deal between thee and me! for even now
I put myself to thy direction, and
Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure
The taints and blames I laid upon myself,
For strangers to my nature. I am yet
Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,
At no time broke my faith, would not betray
The devil to his fellow and delight
No less in truth than life: my first false speaking
Was this upon myself: what I am truly,
Is thine and my poor country's to command:
Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,
Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,
Already at a point, was setting forth.
Now we'll together; and the chance of goodness
Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?


MACDUFF

Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
'Tis hard to reconcile.
Enter a Doctor


MALCOLM

Well; more anon.--Comes the king forth, I pray you?


Doctor

Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls
That stay his cure: their malady convinces
The great assay of art; but at his touch--
Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand--
They presently amend.


MALCOLM

I thank you, doctor.
Exit Doctor


MACDUFF

What's the disease he means?


MALCOLM

'Tis call'd the evil:
A most miraculous work in this good king;
Which often, since my here-remain in England,
I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,
Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people,
All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,
The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
Put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken,
To the succeeding royalty he leaves
The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,
He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,
And sundry blessings hang about his throne,
That speak him full of grace.
Enter ROSS


MACDUFF

See, who comes here?


MALCOLM

My countryman; but yet I know him not.


MACDUFF

My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.


MALCOLM

I know him now. Good God, betimes remove
The means that makes us strangers!


ROSS

Sir, amen.


MACDUFF

Stands Scotland where it did?


ROSS

Alas, poor country!
Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot
Be call'd our mother, but our grave; where nothing,
But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;
Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air
Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems
A modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell
Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives
Expire before the flowers in their caps,
Dying or ere they sicken.


MACDUFF

O, relation
Too nice, and yet too true!


MALCOLM

What's the newest grief?


ROSS

That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker:
Each minute teems a new one.


MACDUFF

How does my wife?


ROSS

Why, well.


MACDUFF

         And all my children?


ROSS

Well too.


MACDUFF

The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?


ROSS

No; they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.


MACDUFF

But not a niggard of your speech: how goes't?


ROSS

When I came hither to transport the tidings,
Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour
Of many worthy fellows that were out;
Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,
For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot:
Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland
Would create soldiers, make our women fight,
To doff their dire distresses.


MALCOLM

Be't their comfort
We are coming thither: gracious England hath
Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;
An older and a better soldier none
That Christendom gives out.


ROSS

Would I could answer
This comfort with the like! But I have words
That would be howl'd out in the desert air,
Where hearing should not latch them.


MACDUFF

What concern they?
The general cause? or is it a fee-grief
Due to some single breast?


ROSS

No mind that's honest
But in it shares some woe; though the main part
Pertains to you alone.


MACDUFF

If it be mine,
Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.


ROSS

Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,
Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
That ever yet they heard.


MACDUFF

Hum! I guess at it.


ROSS

Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes
Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner,
Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer,
To add the death of you.


MALCOLM

Merciful heaven!
What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows;
Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak
Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.


MACDUFF

My children too?


ROSS

                  Wife, children, servants, all
That could be found.


MACDUFF

And I must be from thence!
My wife kill'd too?


ROSS

I have said.


MALCOLM

Be comforted:
Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,
To cure this deadly grief.


MACDUFF

He has no children. All my pretty ones?
Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?
What, all my pretty chickens and their dam
At one fell swoop?


MALCOLM

Dispute it like a man.


MACDUFF

I shall do so;
But I must also feel it as a man:
I cannot but remember such things were,
That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,
And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,
They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,
Not for their own demerits, but for mine,
Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!


MALCOLM

Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief
Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.


MACDUFF

O, I could play the woman with mine eyes
And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,
Cut short all intermission; front to front
Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;
Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,
Heaven forgive him too!


MALCOLM

This tune goes manly.
Come, go we to the king; our power is ready;
Our lack is nothing but our leave; Macbeth
Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above
Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may:
The night is long that never finds the day.
Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. Dunsinane. Ante-room in the castle.

Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman


Doctor

I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive
no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?


Gentlewoman

Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen
her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon
her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,
write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again
return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.


Doctor

A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once
the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of
watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her
walking and other actual performances, what, at any
time, have you heard her say?


Gentlewoman

That, sir, which I will not report after her.


Doctor

You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.


Gentlewoman

Neither to you nor any one; having no witness to
confirm my speech.
Enter LADY MACBETH, with a taper
Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise;
and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.


Doctor

How came she by that light?


Gentlewoman

Why, it stood by her: she has light by her
continually; 'tis her command.


Doctor

You see, her eyes are open.


Gentlewoman

Ay, but their sense is shut.


Doctor

What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.


Gentlewoman

It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus
washing her hands: I have known her continue in
this a quarter of an hour.


LADY MACBETH

Yet here's a spot.


Doctor

Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from
her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.


LADY MACBETH

Out, damned spot! out, I say!--One: two: why,
then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie, my
lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we
fear who knows it, when none can call our power to
account?--Yet who would have thought the old man
to have had so much blood in him.


Doctor

Do you mark that?


LADY MACBETH

The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?--
What, will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more o'
that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with
this starting.


Doctor

Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.


Gentlewoman

She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of
that: heaven knows what she has known.


LADY MACBETH

Here's the smell of the blood still: all the
perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little
hand. Oh, oh, oh!


Doctor

What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.


Gentlewoman

I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the
dignity of the whole body.


Doctor

Well, well, well,--


Gentlewoman

Pray God it be, sir.


Doctor

This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have known
those which have walked in their sleep who have died
holily in their beds.


LADY MACBETH

Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so
pale.--I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he
cannot come out on's grave.


Doctor

Even so?


LADY MACBETH

To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate:
come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's
done cannot be undone.--To bed, to bed, to bed!
Exit


Doctor

Will she go now to bed?


Gentlewoman

Directly.


Doctor

Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds
Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds
To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:
More needs she the divine than the physician.
God, God forgive us all! Look after her;
Remove from her the means of all annoyance,
And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:
My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.
I think, but dare not speak.


Gentlewoman

Good night, good doctor.
Exeunt

SCENE II. The country near Dunsinane.

Drum and colours. Enter MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS, LENNOX, and Soldiers


MENTEITH

The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,
His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:
Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes
Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
Excite the mortified man.


ANGUS

Near Birnam wood
Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.


CAITHNESS

Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?


LENNOX

For certain, sir, he is not: I have a file
Of all the gentry: there is Siward's son,
And many unrough youths that even now
Protest their first of manhood.


MENTEITH

What does the tyrant?


CAITHNESS

Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies:
Some say he's mad; others that lesser hate him
Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain,
He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause
Within the belt of rule.


ANGUS

Now does he feel
His secret murders sticking on his hands;
Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;
Those he commands move only in command,
Nothing in love: now does he feel his title
Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe
Upon a dwarfish thief.


MENTEITH

Who then shall blame
His pester'd senses to recoil and start,
When all that is within him does condemn
Itself for being there?


CAITHNESS

Well, march we on,
To give obedience where 'tis truly owed:
Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,
And with him pour we in our country's purge
Each drop of us.


LENNOX

                  Or so much as it needs,
To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.
Make we our march towards Birnam.
Exeunt, marching

SCENE III. Dunsinane. A room in the castle.

Enter MACBETH, Doctor, and Attendants


MACBETH

Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:
Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,
I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm?
Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know
All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:
'Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman
Shall e'er have power upon thee.' Then fly,
false thanes,
And mingle with the English epicures:
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.
Enter a Servant
The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!
Where got'st thou that goose look?


Servant

There is ten thousand--


MACBETH

Geese, villain!


Servant

Soldiers, sir.


MACBETH

Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,
Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?
Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine
Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?


Servant

The English force, so please you.


MACBETH

Take thy face hence.
Exit Servant
Seyton!--I am sick at heart,
When I behold--Seyton, I say!--This push
Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.
I have lived long enough: my way of life
Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf;
And that which should accompany old age,
As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,
I must not look to have; but, in their stead,
Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,
Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not. Seyton!
Enter SEYTON


SEYTON

What is your gracious pleasure?


MACBETH

What news more?


SEYTON

All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported.


MACBETH

I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd.
Give me my armour.


SEYTON

'Tis not needed yet.


MACBETH

I'll put it on.
Send out more horses; skirr the country round;
Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.
How does your patient, doctor?


Doctor

Not so sick, my lord,
As she is troubled with thick coming fancies,
That keep her from her rest.


MACBETH

Cure her of that.
Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
Raze out the written troubles of the brain
And with some sweet oblivious antidote
Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff
Which weighs upon the heart?


Doctor

Therein the patient
Must minister to himself.


MACBETH

Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.
Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff.
Seyton, send out. Doctor, the thanes fly from me.
Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast
The water of my land, find her disease,
And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
I would applaud thee to the very echo,
That should applaud again.--Pull't off, I say.--
What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug,
Would scour these English hence? Hear'st thou of them?


Doctor

Ay, my good lord; your royal preparation
Makes us hear something.


MACBETH

Bring it after me.
I will not be afraid of death and bane,
Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.


Doctor

[Aside]  Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,
Profit again should hardly draw me here.
Exeunt

SCENE IV. Country near Birnam wood.

Drum and colours. Enter MALCOLM, SIWARD and YOUNG  SIWARD, MACDUFF, MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS, LENNOX, ROSS, and Soldiers, marching


MALCOLM

Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand
That chambers will be safe.


MENTEITH

We doubt it nothing.


SIWARD

What wood is this before us?


MENTEITH

The wood of Birnam.


MALCOLM

Let every soldier hew him down a bough
And bear't before him: thereby shall we shadow
The numbers of our host and make discovery
Err in report of us.


Soldiers

It shall be done.


SIWARD

We learn no other but the confident tyrant
Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure
Our setting down before 't.


MALCOLM

'Tis his main hope:
For where there is advantage to be given,
Both more and less have given him the revolt,
And none serve with him but constrained things
Whose hearts are absent too.


MACDUFF

Let our just censures
Attend the true event, and put we on
Industrious soldiership.


SIWARD

The time approaches
That will with due decision make us know
What we shall say we have and what we owe.
Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,
But certain issue strokes must arbitrate:
Towards which advance the war.
Exeunt, marching

SCENE V. Dunsinane. Within the castle.

Enter MACBETH, SEYTON, and Soldiers, with drum and colours


MACBETH

Hang out our banners on the outward walls;
The cry is still 'They come:' our castle's strength
Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie
Till famine and the ague eat them up:
Were they not forced with those that should be ours,
We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,
And beat them backward home.
A cry of women within
What is that noise?


SEYTON

It is the cry of women, my good lord.
Exit


MACBETH

I have almost forgot the taste of fears;
The time has been, my senses would have cool'd
To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair
Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
As life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors;
Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts
Cannot once start me.
Re-enter SEYTON
Wherefore was that cry?


SEYTON

The queen, my lord, is dead.


MACBETH

She should have died hereafter;
There would have been a time for such a word.
To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
To the last syllable of recorded time,
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
And then is heard no more: it is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.
Enter a Messenger
Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.


Messenger

Gracious my lord,
I should report that which I say I saw,
But know not how to do it.


MACBETH

Well, say, sir.


Messenger

As I did stand my watch upon the hill,
I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,
The wood began to move.


MACBETH

Liar and slave!


Messenger

Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:
Within this three mile may you see it coming;
I say, a moving grove.


MACBETH

If thou speak'st false,
Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,
Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,
I care not if thou dost for me as much.
I pull in resolution, and begin
To doubt the equivocation of the fiend
That lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam wood
Do come to Dunsinane:'  and now a wood
Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!
If this which he avouches does appear,
There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.
I gin to be aweary of the sun,
And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.
Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
At least we'll die with harness on our back.
Exeunt

SCENE VI. Dunsinane. Before the castle.

Drum and colours. Enter MALCOLM, SIWARD, MACDUFF, and their Army, with boughs


MALCOLM

Now near enough: your leafy screens throw down.
And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle,
Shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son,
Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we
Shall take upon 's what else remains to do,
According to our order.


SIWARD

Fare you well.
Do we but find the tyrant's power to-night,
Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.


MACDUFF

Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,
Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.
Exeunt

SCENE VII. Another part of the field.

Alarums. Enter MACBETH


MACBETH

They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,
But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's he
That was not born of woman? Such a one
Am I to fear, or none.
Enter YOUNG SIWARD


YOUNG SIWARD

What is thy name?


MACBETH

                  Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.


YOUNG SIWARD

No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name
Than any is in hell.


MACBETH

My name's Macbeth.


YOUNG SIWARD

The devil himself could not pronounce a title
More hateful to mine ear.


MACBETH

No, nor more fearful.


YOUNG SIWARD

Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword
I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.
They fight and YOUNG SIWARD is slain


MACBETH

Thou wast born of woman
But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,
Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.
Exit
Alarums. Enter MACDUFF


MACDUFF

That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!
If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,
My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.
I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
Are hired to bear their staves: either thou, Macbeth,
Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge
I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;
By this great clatter, one of greatest note
Seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune!
And more I beg not.
Exit. Alarums
Enter MALCOLM and SIWARD


SIWARD

This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd:
The tyrant's people on both sides do fight;
The noble thanes do bravely in the war;
The day almost itself professes yours,
And little is to do.


MALCOLM

We have met with foes
That strike beside us.


SIWARD

Enter, sir, the castle.
Exeunt. Alarums

SCENE VIII. Another part of the field.

Enter MACBETH


MACBETH

Why should I play the Roman fool, and die
On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes
Do better upon them.
Enter MACDUFF


MACDUFF

Turn, hell-hound, turn!


MACBETH

Of all men else I have avoided thee:
But get thee back; my soul is too much charged
With blood of thine already.


MACDUFF

I have no words:
My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain
Than terms can give thee out!
They fight


MACBETH

Thou losest labour:
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
I bear a charmed life, which must not yield,
To one of woman born.


MACDUFF

Despair thy charm;
And let the angel whom thou still hast served
Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb
Untimely ripp'd.


MACBETH

Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,
For it hath cow'd my better part of man!
And be these juggling fiends no more believed,
That palter with us in a double sense;
That keep the word of promise to our ear,
And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.


MACDUFF

Then yield thee, coward,
And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:
We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,
Painted on a pole, and underwrit,
'Here may you see the tyrant.'


MACBETH

I will not yield,
To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,
And to be baited with the rabble's curse.
Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,
And thou opposed, being of no woman born,
Yet I will try the last. Before my body
I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,
And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'
Exeunt, fighting. Alarums
Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colours, MALCOLM, SIWARD, ROSS, the other Thanes, and Soldiers


MALCOLM

I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.


SIWARD

Some must go off: and yet, by these I see,
So great a day as this is cheaply bought.


MALCOLM

Macduff is missing, and your noble son.


ROSS

Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:
He only lived but till he was a man;
The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd
In the unshrinking station where he fought,
But like a man he died.


SIWARD

Then he is dead?


ROSS

Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow
Must not be measured by his worth, for then
It hath no end.


SIWARD

                  Had he his hurts before?


ROSS

Ay, on the front.


SIWARD

                  Why then, God's soldier be he!
Had I as many sons as I have hairs,
I would not wish them to a fairer death:
And so, his knell is knoll'd.


MALCOLM

He's worth more sorrow,
And that I'll spend for him.


SIWARD

He's worth no more
They say he parted well, and paid his score:
And so, God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.
Re-enter MACDUFF, with MACBETH's head


MACDUFF

Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands
The usurper's cursed head: the time is free:
I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,
That speak my salutation in their minds;
Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:
Hail, King of Scotland!


ALL

Hail, King of Scotland!
Flourish


MALCOLM

We shall not spend a large expense of time
Before we reckon with your several loves,
And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,
Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland
In such an honour named. What's more to do,
Which would be planted newly with the time,
As calling home our exiled friends abroad
That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;
Producing forth the cruel ministers
Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,
Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands
Took off her life; this, and what needful else
That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,
We will perform in measure, time and place:
So, thanks to all at once and to each one,
Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.
Flourish. Exeunt




Measure for Measure

ACT I
SCENE I. An apartment in the DUKE'S palace.

Enter DUKE VINCENTIO, ESCALUS, Lords and Attendants


DUKE VINCENTIO

Escalus.


ESCALUS

My lord.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Of government the properties to unfold,
Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;
Since I am put to know that your own science
Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
My strength can give you: then no more remains,
But that to your sufficiency as your Worth is able,
And let them work. The nature of our people,
Our city's institutions, and the terms
For common justice, you're as pregnant in
As art and practise hath enriched any
That we remember. There is our commission,
From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,
I say, bid come before us Angelo.
Exit an Attendant
What figure of us think you he will bear?
For you must know, we have with special soul
Elected him our absence to supply,
Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,
And given his deputation all the organs
Of our own power: what think you of it?


ESCALUS

If any in Vienna be of worth
To undergo such ample grace and honour,
It is Lord Angelo.


DUKE VINCENTIO

                  Look where he comes.
Enter ANGELO


ANGELO

Always obedient to your grace's will,
I come to know your pleasure.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Angelo,
There is a kind of character in thy life,
That to the observer doth thy history
Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
Are not thine own so proper as to waste
Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends
The smallest scruple of her excellence
But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
Herself the glory of a creditor,
Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
To one that can my part in him advertise;
Hold therefore, Angelo:--
In our remove be thou at full ourself;
Mortality and mercy in Vienna
Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,
Though first in question, is thy secondary.
Take thy commission.


ANGELO

Now, good my lord,
Let there be some more test made of my metal,
Before so noble and so great a figure
Be stamp'd upon it.


DUKE VINCENTIO

No more evasion:
We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.
Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd
Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
As time and our concernings shall importune,
How it goes with us, and do look to know
What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;
To the hopeful execution do I leave you
Of your commissions.


ANGELO

Yet give leave, my lord,
That we may bring you something on the way.


DUKE VINCENTIO

My haste may not admit it;
Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do
With any scruple; your scope is as mine own
So to enforce or qualify the laws
As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:
I'll privily away. I love the people,
But do not like to stage me to their eyes:
Through it do well, I do not relish well
Their loud applause and Aves vehement;
Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.


ANGELO

The heavens give safety to your purposes!


ESCALUS

Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!


DUKE

I thank you. Fare you well.
Exit


ESCALUS

I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
To look into the bottom of my place:
A power I have, but of what strength and nature
I am not yet instructed.


ANGELO

'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
And we may soon our satisfaction have
Touching that point.


ESCALUS

I'll wait upon your honour.
Exeunt

SCENE II. A Street.

Enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen


LUCIO

If the duke with the other dukes come not to
composition with the King of Hungary, why then all
the dukes fall upon the king.


First Gentleman

Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of
Hungary's!


Second Gentleman

Amen.


LUCIO

Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that
went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped
one out of the table.


Second Gentleman

'Thou shalt not steal'?


LUCIO

Ay, that he razed.


First Gentleman

Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain and
all the rest from their functions: they put forth
to steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in
the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition
well that prays for peace.


Second Gentleman

I never heard any soldier dislike it.


LUCIO

I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where
grace was said.


Second Gentleman

No? a dozen times at least.


First Gentleman

What, in metre?


LUCIO

In any proportion or in any language.


First Gentleman

I think, or in any religion.


LUCIO

Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all
controversy: as, for example, thou thyself art a
wicked villain, despite of all grace.


First Gentleman

Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.


LUCIO

I grant; as there may between the lists and the
velvet. Thou art the list.


First Gentleman

And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rt
a three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as lief
be a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou
art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak
feelingly now?


LUCIO

I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful
feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own
confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I
live, forget to drink after thee.


First Gentleman

I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?


Second Gentleman

Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.


LUCIO

Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I
have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to--


Second Gentleman

To what, I pray?


LUCIO

Judge.


Second Gentleman

To three thousand dolours a year.


First Gentleman

Ay, and more.


LUCIO

A French crown more.


First Gentleman

Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou
art full of error; I am sound.


LUCIO

Nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound as
things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;
impiety has made a feast of thee.
Enter MISTRESS OVERDONE


First Gentleman

How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?


MISTRESS OVERDONE

Well, well; there's one yonder arrested and carried
to prison was worth five thousand of you all.


Second Gentleman

Who's that, I pray thee?


MISTRESS OVERDONE

Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.


First Gentleman

Claudio to prison? 'tis not so.


MISTRESS OVERDONE

Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, saw
him carried away; and, which is more, within these
three days his head to be chopped off.


LUCIO

But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so.
Art thou sure of this?


MISTRESS OVERDONE

I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam
Julietta with child.


LUCIO

Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me two
hours since, and he was ever precise in
promise-keeping.


Second Gentleman

Besides, you know, it draws something near to the
speech we had to such a purpose.


First Gentleman

But, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.


LUCIO

Away! let's go learn the truth of it.
Exeunt LUCIO and Gentlemen


MISTRESS OVERDONE

Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what
with the gallows and what with poverty, I am
custom-shrunk.
Enter POMPEY
How now! what's the news with you?


POMPEY

Yonder man is carried to prison.


MISTRESS OVERDONE

Well; what has he done?


POMPEY

A woman.


MISTRESS OVERDONE

But what's his offence?


POMPEY

Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.


MISTRESS OVERDONE

What, is there a maid with child by him?


POMPEY

No, but there's a woman with maid by him. You have
not heard of the proclamation, have you?


MISTRESS OVERDONE

What proclamation, man?


POMPEY

All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.


MISTRESS OVERDONE

And what shall become of those in the city?


POMPEY

They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too,
but that a wise burgher put in for them.


MISTRESS OVERDONE

But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be
pulled down?


POMPEY

To the ground, mistress.


MISTRESS OVERDONE

Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!
What shall become of me?


POMPEY

Come; fear you not: good counsellors lack no
clients: though you change your place, you need not
change your trade; I'll be your tapster still.
Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that
have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you
will be considered.


MISTRESS OVERDONE

What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw.


POMPEY

Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to
prison; and there's Madam Juliet.
Exeunt
Enter Provost, CLAUDIO, JULIET, and Officers


CLAUDIO

Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?
Bear me to prison, where I am committed.


Provost

I do it not in evil disposition,
But from Lord Angelo by special charge.


CLAUDIO

Thus can the demigod Authority
Make us pay down for our offence by weight
The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;
On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.
Re-enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen


LUCIO

Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?


CLAUDIO

From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:
As surfeit is the father of much fast,
So every scope by the immoderate use
Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,
Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,
A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.


LUCIO

If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would
send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say
the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom
as the morality of imprisonment. What's thy
offence, Claudio?


CLAUDIO

What but to speak of would offend again.


LUCIO

What, is't murder?


CLAUDIO

No.


LUCIO

Lechery?


CLAUDIO

Call it so.


Provost

Away, sir! you must go.


CLAUDIO

One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.


LUCIO

A hundred, if they'll do you any good.
Is lechery so look'd after?


CLAUDIO

Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
I got possession of Julietta's bed:
You know the lady; she is fast my wife,
Save that we do the denunciation lack
Of outward order: this we came not to,
Only for propagation of a dower
Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
Till time had made them for us. But it chances
The stealth of our most mutual entertainment
With character too gross is writ on Juliet.


LUCIO

With child, perhaps?


CLAUDIO

Unhappily, even so.
And the new deputy now for the duke--
Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,
Or whether that the body public be
A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;
Whether the tyranny be in his place,
Or in his emmence that fills it up,
I stagger in:--but this new governor
Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall
So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
And none of them been worn; and, for a name,
Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.


LUCIO

I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on
thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love,
may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to
him.


CLAUDIO

I have done so, but he's not to be found.
I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:
This day my sister should the cloister enter
And there receive her approbation:
Acquaint her with the danger of my state:
Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends
To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:
I have great hope in that; for in her youth
There is a prone and speechless dialect,
Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art
When she will play with reason and discourse,
And well she can persuade.


LUCIO

I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the
like, which else would stand under grievous
imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I
would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a
game of tick-tack. I'll to her.


CLAUDIO

I thank you, good friend Lucio.


LUCIO

Within two hours.


CLAUDIO

                  Come, officer, away!
Exeunt

SCENE III. A monastery.

Enter DUKE VINCENTIO and FRIAR THOMAS


DUKE VINCENTIO

No, holy father; throw away that thought;
Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose
More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
Of burning youth.


FRIAR THOMAS

                  May your grace speak of it?


DUKE VINCENTIO

My holy sir, none better knows than you
How I have ever loved the life removed
And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.
I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,
And so it is received. Now, pious sir,
You will demand of me why I do this?


FRIAR THOMAS

Gladly, my lord.


DUKE VINCENTIO

We have strict statutes and most biting laws.
The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,
Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;
Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,
That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,
Only to stick it in their children's sight
For terror, not to use, in time the rod
Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,
Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;
And liberty plucks justice by the nose;
The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart
Goes all decorum.


FRIAR THOMAS

                  It rested in your grace
To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:
And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
Than in Lord Angelo.


DUKE VINCENTIO

I do fear, too dreadful:
Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,
When evil deeds have their permissive pass
And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,
I have on Angelo imposed the office;
Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,
And yet my nature never in the fight
To do in slander. And to behold his sway,
I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,
Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,
Supply me with the habit and instruct me
How I may formally in person bear me
Like a true friar. More reasons for this action
At our more leisure shall I render you;
Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;
Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses
That his blood flows, or that his appetite
Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,
If power change purpose, what our seemers be.
Exeunt

SCENE IV. A nunnery.

Enter ISABELLA and FRANCISCA


ISABELLA

And have you nuns no farther privileges?


FRANCISCA

Are not these large enough?


ISABELLA

Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more;
But rather wishing a more strict restraint
Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.


LUCIO

[Within]  Ho! Peace be in this place!


ISABELLA

Who's that which calls?


FRANCISCA

It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,
Turn you the key, and know his business of him;
You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn.
When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men
But in the presence of the prioress:
Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,
Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.
He calls again; I pray you, answer him.
Exit


ISABELLA

Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls
Enter LUCIO


LUCIO

Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses
Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me
As bring me to the sight of Isabella,
A novice of this place and the fair sister
To her unhappy brother Claudio?


ISABELLA

Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,
The rather for I now must make you know
I am that Isabella and his sister.


LUCIO

Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:
Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.


ISABELLA

Woe me! for what?


LUCIO

For that which, if myself might be his judge,
He should receive his punishment in thanks:
He hath got his friend with child.


ISABELLA

Sir, make me not your story.


LUCIO

It is true.
I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin
With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,
Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:
I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.
By your renouncement an immortal spirit,
And to be talk'd with in sincerity,
As with a saint.


ISABELLA

You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.


LUCIO

Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:
Your brother and his lover have embraced:
As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time
That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb
Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.


ISABELLA

Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?


LUCIO

Is she your cousin?


ISABELLA

Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names
By vain though apt affection.


LUCIO

She it is.


ISABELLA

O, let him marry her.


LUCIO

This is the point.
The duke is very strangely gone from hence;
Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,
In hand and hope of action: but we do learn
By those that know the very nerves of state,
His givings-out were of an infinite distance
From his true-meant design. Upon his place,
And with full line of his authority,
Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood
Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
The wanton stings and motions of the sense,
But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
With profits of the mind, study and fast.
He--to give fear to use and liberty,
Which have for long run by the hideous law,
As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,
Under whose heavy sense your brother's life
Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;
And follows close the rigour of the statute,
To make him an example. All hope is gone,
Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business
'Twixt you and your poor brother.


ISABELLA

Doth he so seek his life?


LUCIO

Has censured him
Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath
A warrant for his execution.


ISABELLA

Alas! what poor ability's in me
To do him good?


LUCIO

                  Assay the power you have.


ISABELLA

My power? Alas, I doubt--


LUCIO

Our doubts are traitors
And make us lose the good we oft might win
By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,
And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,
All their petitions are as freely theirs
As they themselves would owe them.


ISABELLA

I'll see what I can do.


LUCIO

But speedily.


ISABELLA

I will about it straight;
No longer staying but to give the mother
Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:
Commend me to my brother: soon at night
I'll send him certain word of my success.


LUCIO

I take my leave of you.


ISABELLA

Good sir, adieu.
Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. A hall In ANGELO's house.

Enter ANGELO, ESCALUS, and a Justice, Provost, Officers, and other Attendants, behind


ANGELO

We must not make a scarecrow of the law,
Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,
And let it keep one shape, till custom make it
Their perch and not their terror.


ESCALUS

Ay, but yet
Let us be keen, and rather cut a little,
Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman
Whom I would save, had a most noble father!
Let but your honour know,
Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,
That, in the working of your own affections,
Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,
Or that the resolute acting of your blood
Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,
Whether you had not sometime in your life
Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
And pull'd the law upon you.


ANGELO

'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,
Another thing to fall. I not deny,
The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,
May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,
That justice seizes: what know the laws
That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,
The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't
Because we see it; but what we do not see
We tread upon, and never think of it.
You may not so extenuate his offence
For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,
When I, that censure him, do so offend,
Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,
And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.


ESCALUS

Be it as your wisdom will.


ANGELO

Where is the provost?


Provost

Here, if it like your honour.


ANGELO

See that Claudio
Be executed by nine to-morrow morning:
Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared;
For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.
Exit Provost


ESCALUS

[Aside]  Well, heaven forgive him! and forgive us all!
Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall:
Some run from brakes of ice, and answer none:
And some condemned for a fault alone.
Enter ELBOW, and Officers with FROTH and POMPEY


ELBOW

Come, bring them away: if these be good people in
a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in
common houses, I know no law: bring them away.


ANGELO

How now, sir! What's your name? and what's the matter?


ELBOW

If it Please your honour, I am the poor duke's
constable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon
justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good
honour two notorious benefactors.


ANGELO

Benefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? are
they not malefactors?


ELBOW

If it? please your honour, I know not well what they
are: but precise villains they are, that I am sure
of; and void of all profanation in the world that
good Christians ought to have.


ESCALUS

This comes off well; here's a wise officer.


ANGELO

Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your
name? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?


POMPEY

He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.


ANGELO

What are you, sir?


ELBOW

He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that
serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they
say, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she
professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.


ESCALUS

How know you that?


ELBOW

My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,--


ESCALUS

How? thy wife?


ELBOW

Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,--


ESCALUS

Dost thou detest her therefore?


ELBOW

I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as
she, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house,
it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.


ESCALUS

How dost thou know that, constable?


ELBOW

Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman
cardinally given, might have been accused in
fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.


ESCALUS

By the woman's means?


ELBOW

Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as she
spit in his face, so she defied him.


POMPEY

Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.


ELBOW

Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable
man; prove it.


ESCALUS

Do you hear how he misplaces?


POMPEY

Sir, she came in great with child; and longing,
saving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes;
sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very
distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a
dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen
such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very
good dishes,--


ESCALUS

Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.


POMPEY

No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in
the right: but to the point. As I say, this
Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and
being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for
prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,
Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the
rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very
honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could
not give you three-pence again.


FROTH

No, indeed.


POMPEY

Very well: you being then, if you be remembered,
cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,--


FROTH

Ay, so I did indeed.


POMPEY

Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be
remembered, that such a one and such a one were past
cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very
good diet, as I told you,--


FROTH

All this is true.


POMPEY

Why, very well, then,--


ESCALUS

Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What
was done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause to
complain of? Come me to what was done to her.


POMPEY

Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.


ESCALUS

No, sir, nor I mean it not.


POMPEY

Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's
leave. And, I beseech you, look into Master Froth
here, sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whose
father died at Hallowmas: was't not at Hallowmas,
Master Froth?


FROTH

All-hallond eve.


POMPEY

Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir,
sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in
the Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delight
to sit, have you not?


FROTH

I have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.


POMPEY

Why, very well, then; I hope here be truths.


ANGELO

This will last out a night in Russia,
When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.
And leave you to the hearing of the cause;
Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.


ESCALUS

I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.
Exit ANGELO
Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more?


POMPEY

Once, sir? there was nothing done to her once.


ELBOW

I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.


POMPEY

I beseech your honour, ask me.


ESCALUS

Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her?


POMPEY

I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face.
Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a
good purpose. Doth your honour mark his face?


ESCALUS

Ay, sir, very well.


POMPEY

Nay; I beseech you, mark it well.


ESCALUS

Well, I do so.


POMPEY

Doth your honour see any harm in his face?


ESCALUS

Why, no.


POMPEY

I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst
thing about him. Good, then; if his face be the
worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do the
constable's wife any harm? I would know that of
your honour.


ESCALUS

He's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?


ELBOW

First, an it like you, the house is a respected
house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his
mistress is a respected woman.


POMPEY

By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected
person than any of us all.


ELBOW

Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the
time has yet to come that she was ever respected
with man, woman, or child.


POMPEY

Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.


ESCALUS

Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is
this true?


ELBOW

O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked
Hannibal! I respected with her before I was married
to her! If ever I was respected with her, or she
with me, let not your worship think me the poor
duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or
I'll have mine action of battery on thee.


ESCALUS

If he took you a box o' the ear, you might have your
action of slander too.


ELBOW

Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't
your worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?


ESCALUS

Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him
that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him
continue in his courses till thou knowest what they
are.


ELBOW

Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou
wicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art
to continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue.


ESCALUS

Where were you born, friend?


FROTH

Here in Vienna, sir.


ESCALUS

Are you of fourscore pounds a year?


FROTH

Yes, an't please you, sir.


ESCALUS

So. What trade are you of, sir?


POMPHEY

Tapster; a poor widow's tapster.


ESCALUS

Your mistress' name?


POMPHEY

Mistress Overdone.


ESCALUS

Hath she had any more than one husband?


POMPEY

Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.


ESCALUS

Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master
Froth, I would not have you acquainted with
tapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth, and you
will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no
more of you.


FROTH

I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never
come into any room in a tap-house, but I am drawn
in.


ESCALUS

Well, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell.
Exit FROTH
Come you hither to me, Master tapster. What's your
name, Master tapster?


POMPEY

Pompey.


ESCALUS

What else?


POMPEY

Bum, sir.


ESCALUS

Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you;
so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the
Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,
howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you
not? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.


POMPEY

Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.


ESCALUS

How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? What
do you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?


POMPEY

If the law would allow it, sir.


ESCALUS

But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall
not be allowed in Vienna.


POMPEY

Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the
youth of the city?


ESCALUS

No, Pompey.


POMPEY

Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then.
If your worship will take order for the drabs and
the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.


ESCALUS

There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you:
it is but heading and hanging.


POMPEY

If you head and hang all that offend that way but
for ten year together, you'll be glad to give out a
commission for more heads: if this law hold in
Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in it
after three-pence a bay: if you live to see this
come to pass, say Pompey told you so.


ESCALUS

Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your
prophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not find
you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever;
no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey,
I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd
Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall
have you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.


POMPEY

I thank your worship for your good counsel:
Aside
but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall
better determine.
Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade:
The valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade.
Exit


ESCALUS

Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master
constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?


ELBOW

Seven year and a half, sir.


ESCALUS

I thought, by your readiness in the office, you had
continued in it some time. You say, seven years together?


ELBOW

And a half, sir.


ESCALUS

Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do you
wrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there not men
in your ward sufficient to serve it?


ELBOW

Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they
are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I
do it for some piece of money, and go through with
all.


ESCALUS

Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven,
the most sufficient of your parish.


ELBOW

To your worship's house, sir?


ESCALUS

To my house. Fare you well.
Exit ELBOW
What's o'clock, think you?


Justice

Eleven, sir.


ESCALUS

I pray you home to dinner with me.


Justice

I humbly thank you.


ESCALUS

It grieves me for the death of Claudio;
But there's no remedy.


Justice

Lord Angelo is severe.


ESCALUS

It is but needful:
Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;
Pardon is still the nurse of second woe:
But yet,--poor Claudio! There is no remedy.
Come, sir.
Exeunt

SCENE II. Another room in the same.

Enter Provost and a Servant


Servant

He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight
I'll tell him of you.


Provost

Pray you, do.
Exit Servant
I'll know
His pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,
He hath but as offended in a dream!
All sects, all ages smack of this vice; and he
To die for't!
Enter ANGELO


ANGELO

                  Now, what's the matter. Provost?


Provost

Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?


ANGELO

Did not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?
Why dost thou ask again?


Provost

Lest I might be too rash:
Under your good correction, I have seen,
When, after execution, judgment hath
Repented o'er his doom.


ANGELO

Go to; let that be mine:
Do you your office, or give up your place,
And you shall well be spared.


Provost

I crave your honour's pardon.
What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?
She's very near her hour.


ANGELO

Dispose of her
To some more fitter place, and that with speed.
Re-enter Servant


Servant

Here is the sister of the man condemn'd
Desires access to you.


ANGELO

Hath he a sister?


Provost

Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,
And to be shortly of a sisterhood,
If not already.


ANGELO

                  Well, let her be admitted.
Exit Servant
See you the fornicatress be removed:
Let have needful, but not lavish, means;
There shall be order for't.
Enter ISABELLA and LUCIO


Provost

God save your honour!


ANGELO

Stay a little while.
To ISABELLA
You're welcome: what's your will?


ISABELLA

I am a woeful suitor to your honour,
Please but your honour hear me.


ANGELO

Well; what's your suit?


ISABELLA

There is a vice that most I do abhor,
And most desire should meet the blow of justice;
For which I would not plead, but that I must;
For which I must not plead, but that I am
At war 'twixt will and will not.


ANGELO

Well; the matter?


ISABELLA

I have a brother is condemn'd to die:
I do beseech you, let it be his fault,
And not my brother.


Provost

[Aside]  Heaven give thee moving graces!


ANGELO

Condemn the fault and not the actor of it?
Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done:
Mine were the very cipher of a function,
To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,
And let go by the actor.


ISABELLA

O just but severe law!
I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!


LUCIO

[Aside to ISABELLA]  Give't not o'er so: to him
again, entreat him;
Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown:
You are too cold; if you should need a pin,
You could not with more tame a tongue desire it:
To him, I say!


ISABELLA

Must he needs die?


ANGELO

                  Maiden, no remedy.


ISABELLA

Yes; I do think that you might pardon him,
And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.


ANGELO

I will not do't.


ISABELLA

                  But can you, if you would?


ANGELO

Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.


ISABELLA

But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,
If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
A s mine is to him?


ANGELO

                  He's sentenced; 'tis too late.


LUCIO

[Aside to ISABELLA]  You are too cold.


ISABELLA

Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word.
May call it back again. Well, believe this,
No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,
Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,
Become them with one half so good a grace
As mercy does.
If he had been as you and you as he,
You would have slipt like him; but he, like you,
Would not have been so stern.


ANGELO

Pray you, be gone.


ISABELLA

I would to heaven I had your potency,
And you were Isabel! should it then be thus?
No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,
And what a prisoner.


LUCIO

[Aside to ISABELLA]
Ay, touch him; there's the vein.


ANGELO

Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
And you but waste your words.


ISABELLA

Alas, alas!
Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;
And He that might the vantage best have took
Found out the remedy. How would you be,
If He, which is the top of judgment, should
But judge you as you are? O, think on that;
And mercy then will breathe within your lips,
Like man new made.


ANGELO

                  Be you content, fair maid;
It is the law, not I condemn your brother:
Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,
It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.


ISABELLA

To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!
He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens
We kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven
With less respect than we do minister
To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;
Who is it that hath died for this offence?
There's many have committed it.


LUCIO

[Aside to ISABELLA]           Ay, well said.


ANGELO

The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:
Those many had not dared to do that evil,
If the first that did the edict infringe
Had answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake
Takes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,
Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,
Either new, or by remissness new-conceived,
And so in progress to be hatch'd and born,
Are now to have no successive degrees,
But, ere they live, to end.


ISABELLA

Yet show some pity.


ANGELO

I show it most of all when I show justice;
For then I pity those I do not know,
Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall;
And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,
Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;
Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.


ISABELLA

So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
And he, that suffer's. O, it is excellent
To have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous
To use it like a giant.


LUCIO

[Aside to ISABELLA]   That's well said.


ISABELLA

Could great men thunder
As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,
For every pelting, petty officer
Would use his heaven for thunder;
Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,
Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
Than the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,
Drest in a little brief authority,
Most ignorant of what he's most assured,
His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
As make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,
Would all themselves laugh mortal.


LUCIO

[Aside to ISABELLA]  O, to him, to him, wench! he
will relent;
He's coming; I perceive 't.


Provost

[Aside]  Pray heaven she win him!


ISABELLA

We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:
Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,
But in the less foul profanation.


LUCIO

Thou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that.


ISABELLA

That in the captain's but a choleric word,
Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.


LUCIO

[Aside to ISABELLA]  Art avised o' that? more on 't.


ANGELO

Why do you put these sayings upon me?


ISABELLA

Because authority, though it err like others,
Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,
That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;
Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
That's like my brother's fault: if it confess
A natural guiltiness such as is his,
Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
Against my brother's life.


ANGELO

[Aside]                  She speaks, and 'tis
Such sense, that my sense breeds with it. Fare you well.


ISABELLA

Gentle my lord, turn back.


ANGELO

I will bethink me: come again tomorrow.


ISABELLA

Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.


ANGELO

How! bribe me?


ISABELLA

Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.


LUCIO

[Aside to ISABELLA]  You had marr'd all else.


ISABELLA

Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,
Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
As fancy values them; but with true prayers
That shall be up at heaven and enter there
Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,
From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
To nothing temporal.


ANGELO

Well; come to me to-morrow.


LUCIO

[Aside to ISABELLA]  Go to; 'tis well; away!


ISABELLA

Heaven keep your honour safe!


ANGELO

[Aside]	Amen:
For I am that way going to temptation,
Where prayers cross.


ISABELLA

At what hour to-morrow
Shall I attend your lordship?


ANGELO

At any time 'fore noon.


ISABELLA

'Save your honour!
Exeunt ISABELLA, LUCIO, and Provost


ANGELO

                  From thee, even from thy virtue!
What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?
The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
Ha!
Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I
That, lying by the violet in the sun,
Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,
Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be
That modesty may more betray our sense
Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,
Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!
What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?
Dost thou desire her foully for those things
That make her good? O, let her brother live!
Thieves for their robbery have authority
When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,
That I desire to hear her speak again,
And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?
O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,
With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous
Is that temptation that doth goad us on
To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,
With all her double vigour, art and nature,
Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid
Subdues me quite. Even till now,
When men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how.
Exit

SCENE III. A room in a prison.

Enter, severally, DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as a friar, and Provost


DUKE VINCENTIO

Hail to you, provost! so I think you are.


Provost

I am the provost. What's your will, good friar?


DUKE VINCENTIO

Bound by my charity and my blest order,
I come to visit the afflicted spirits
Here in the prison. Do me the common right
To let me see them and to make me know
The nature of their crimes, that I may minister
To them accordingly.


Provost

I would do more than that, if more were needful.
Enter JULIET
Look, here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine,
Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,
Hath blister'd her report: she is with child;
And he that got it, sentenced; a young man
More fit to do another such offence
Than die for this.


DUKE VINCENTIO

When must he die?


Provost

                  As I do think, to-morrow.
I have provided for you: stay awhile,
To JULIET
And you shall be conducted.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?


JULIET

I do; and bear the shame most patiently.


DUKE VINCENTIO

I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
And try your penitence, if it be sound,
Or hollowly put on.


JULIET

I'll gladly learn.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Love you the man that wrong'd you?


JULIET

Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.


DUKE VINCENTIO

So then it seems your most offenceful act
Was mutually committed?


JULIET

Mutually.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.


JULIET

I do confess it, and repent it, father.


DUKE VINCENTIO

'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,
As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,
Which sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven,
Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,
But as we stand in fear,--


JULIET

I do repent me, as it is an evil,
And take the shame with joy.


DUKE VINCENTIO

There rest.
Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,
And I am going with instruction to him.
Grace go with you, Benedicite!
Exit


JULIET

Must die to-morrow! O injurious love,
That respites me a life, whose very comfort
Is still a dying horror!


Provost

'Tis pity of him.
Exeunt

SCENE IV. A room in ANGELO's house.

Enter ANGELO


ANGELO

When I would pray and think, I think and pray
To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;
Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,
Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,
As if I did but only chew his name;
And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
Of my conception. The state, whereon I studied
Is like a good thing, being often read,
Grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,
Wherein--let no man hear me--I take pride,
Could I with boot change for an idle plume,
Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:
Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:
'Tis not the devil's crest.
Enter a Servant
How now! who's there?


Servant

One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.


ANGELO

Teach her the way.
Exit Servant
O heavens!
Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,
Making both it unable for itself,
And dispossessing all my other parts
Of necessary fitness?
So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;
Come all to help him, and so stop the air
By which he should revive: and even so
The general, subject to a well-wish'd king,
Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness
Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love
Must needs appear offence.
Enter ISABELLA
How now, fair maid?


ISABELLA

I am come to know your pleasure.


ANGELO

That you might know it, would much better please me
Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.


ISABELLA

Even so. Heaven keep your honour!


ANGELO

Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,


As long as you or I

yet he must die.


ISABELLA

Under your sentence?


ANGELO

Yea.


ISABELLA

When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,
Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted
That his soul sicken not.


ANGELO

Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
To pardon him that hath from nature stolen
A man already made, as to remit
Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy
Falsely to take away a life true made
As to put metal in restrained means
To make a false one.


ISABELLA

'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.


ANGELO

Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.
Which had you rather, that the most just law
Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,
Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
As she that he hath stain'd?


ISABELLA

Sir, believe this,
I had rather give my body than my soul.


ANGELO

I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins
Stand more for number than for accompt.


ISABELLA

How say you?


ANGELO

Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
Against the thing I say. Answer to this:
I, now the voice of the recorded law,
Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life:
Might there not be a charity in sin
To save this brother's life?


ISABELLA

Please you to do't,
I'll take it as a peril to my soul,
It is no sin at all, but charity.


ANGELO

Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,
Were equal poise of sin and charity.


ISABELLA

That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,
If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer
To have it added to the faults of mine,
And nothing of your answer.


ANGELO

Nay, but hear me.
Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,
Or seem so craftily; and that's not good.


ISABELLA

Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,
But graciously to know I am no better.


ANGELO

Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
When it doth tax itself; as these black masks
Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me;
To be received plain, I'll speak more gross:
Your brother is to die.


ISABELLA

So.


ANGELO

And his offence is so, as it appears,
Accountant to the law upon that pain.


ISABELLA

True.


ANGELO

Admit no other way to save his life,--
As I subscribe not that, nor any other,
But in the loss of question,--that you, his sister,
Finding yourself desired of such a person,
Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,
Could fetch your brother from the manacles
Of the all-building law; and that there were
No earthly mean to save him, but that either
You must lay down the treasures of your body
To this supposed, or else to let him suffer;
What would you do?


ISABELLA

As much for my poor brother as myself:
That is, were I under the terms of death,
The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,
And strip myself to death, as to a bed
That longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield
My body up to shame.


ANGELO

Then must your brother die.


ISABELLA

And 'twere the cheaper way:
Better it were a brother died at once,
Than that a sister, by redeeming him,
Should die for ever.


ANGELO

Were not you then as cruel as the sentence
That you have slander'd so?


ISABELLA

Ignomy in ransom and free pardon
Are of two houses: lawful mercy
Is nothing kin to foul redemption.


ANGELO

You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
And rather proved the sliding of your brother
A merriment than a vice.


ISABELLA

O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,
To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:
I something do excuse the thing I hate,
For his advantage that I dearly love.


ANGELO

We are all frail.


ISABELLA

                  Else let my brother die,
If not a feodary, but only he
Owe and succeed thy weakness.


ANGELO

Nay, women are frail too.


ISABELLA

Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves;
Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar
In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;
For we are soft as our complexions are,
And credulous to false prints.


ANGELO

I think it well:
And from this testimony of your own sex,--
Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
Than faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold;
I do arrest your words. Be that you are,
That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;
If you be one, as you are well express'd
By all external warrants, show it now,
By putting on the destined livery.


ISABELLA

I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,
Let me entreat you speak the former language.


ANGELO

Plainly conceive, I love you.


ISABELLA

My brother did love Juliet,
And you tell me that he shall die for it.


ANGELO

He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.


ISABELLA

I know your virtue hath a licence in't,
Which seems a little fouler than it is,
To pluck on others.


ANGELO

Believe me, on mine honour,
My words express my purpose.


ISABELLA

Ha! little honour to be much believed,
And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!
I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:
Sign me a present pardon for my brother,
Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud
What man thou art.


ANGELO

                  Who will believe thee, Isabel?
My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,
My vouch against you, and my place i' the state,
Will so your accusation overweigh,
That you shall stifle in your own report
And smell of calumny. I have begun,
And now I give my sensual race the rein:
Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;
Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,
That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother
By yielding up thy body to my will;
Or else he must not only die the death,
But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,
Or, by the affection that now guides me most,
I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,
Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.
Exit


ISABELLA

To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,
That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,
Either of condemnation or approof;
Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:
Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,
To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:
Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,
Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.
That, had he twenty heads to tender down
On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,
Before his sister should her body stoop
To such abhorr'd pollution.
Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:
More than our brother is our chastity.
I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.
Exit

ACT III
SCENE I. A room in the prison.

Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before, CLAUDIO, and Provost


DUKE VINCENTIO

So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?


CLAUDIO

The miserable have no other medicine
But only hope:
I've hope to live, and am prepared to die.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Be absolute for death; either death or life
Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:
If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,
Servile to all the skyey influences,
That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,
Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;
For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun
And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;
For all the accommodations that thou bear'st
Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;
For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st
Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;
For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains
That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,
And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;
For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,
After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,
And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;
For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,
The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,
For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,
But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,
Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth
Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms
Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,
Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,
To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this
That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,
That makes these odds all even.


CLAUDIO

I humbly thank you.
To sue to live, I find I seek to die;
And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.


ISABELLA

[Within]  What, ho! Peace here; grace and good company!


Provost

Who's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.


CLAUDIO

Most holy sir, I thank you.
Enter ISABELLA


ISABELLA

My business is a word or two with Claudio.


Provost

And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Provost, a word with you.


Provost

As many as you please.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.
Exeunt DUKE VINCENTIO and Provost


CLAUDIO

Now, sister, what's the comfort?


ISABELLA

Why,
As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.
Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,
Intends you for his swift ambassador,
Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:
Therefore your best appointment make with speed;
To-morrow you set on.


CLAUDIO

Is there no remedy?


ISABELLA

None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
To cleave a heart in twain.


CLAUDIO

But is there any?


ISABELLA

Yes, brother, you may live:
There is a devilish mercy in the judge,
If you'll implore it, that will free your life,
But fetter you till death.


CLAUDIO

Perpetual durance?


ISABELLA

Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
Though all the world's vastidity you had,
To a determined scope.


CLAUDIO

But in what nature?


ISABELLA

In such a one as, you consenting to't,
Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,
And leave you naked.


CLAUDIO

Let me know the point.


ISABELLA

O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,
And six or seven winters more respect
Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?
The sense of death is most in apprehension;
And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,
In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
As when a giant dies.


CLAUDIO

Why give you me this shame?
Think you I can a resolution fetch
From flowery tenderness? If I must die,
I will encounter darkness as a bride,
And hug it in mine arms.


ISABELLA

There spake my brother; there my father's grave
Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:
Thou art too noble to conserve a life
In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,
Whose settled visage and deliberate word
Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew
As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil
His filth within being cast, he would appear
A pond as deep as hell.


CLAUDIO

The prenzie Angelo!


ISABELLA

O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,
The damned'st body to invest and cover
In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?
If I would yield him my virginity,
Thou mightst be freed.


CLAUDIO

O heavens! it cannot be.


ISABELLA

Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
So to offend him still. This night's the time
That I should do what I abhor to name,
Or else thou diest to-morrow.


CLAUDIO

Thou shalt not do't.


ISABELLA

O, were it but my life,
I'ld throw it down for your deliverance
As frankly as a pin.


CLAUDIO

Thanks, dear Isabel.


ISABELLA

Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.


CLAUDIO

Yes. Has he affections in him,
That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,
When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,
Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.


ISABELLA

Which is the least?


CLAUDIO

If it were damnable, he being so wise,
Why would he for the momentary trick
Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!


ISABELLA

What says my brother?


CLAUDIO

Death is a fearful thing.


ISABELLA

And shamed life a hateful.


CLAUDIO

Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;
This sensible warm motion to become
A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside
In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,
And blown with restless violence round about
The pendent world; or to be worse than worst
Of those that lawless and incertain thought
Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!
The weariest and most loathed worldly life
That age, ache, penury and imprisonment
Can lay on nature is a paradise
To what we fear of death.


ISABELLA

Alas, alas!


CLAUDIO

          Sweet sister, let me live:
What sin you do to save a brother's life,
Nature dispenses with the deed so far
That it becomes a virtue.


ISABELLA

O you beast!
O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
Is't not a kind of incest, to take life
From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?
Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!
For such a warped slip of wilderness
Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!
Die, perish! Might but my bending down
Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
No word to save thee.


CLAUDIO

Nay, hear me, Isabel.


ISABELLA

O, fie, fie, fie!
Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.
Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:
'Tis best thou diest quickly.


CLAUDIO

O hear me, Isabella!
Re-enter DUKE VINCENTIO


DUKE VINCENTIO

Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.


ISABELLA

What is your will?


DUKE VINCENTIO

Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and
by have some speech with you: the satisfaction I
would require is likewise your own benefit.


ISABELLA

I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be
stolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.
Walks apart


DUKE VINCENTIO

Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you
and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to
corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her
virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition
of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,
hath made him that gracious denial which he is most
glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I
know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to
death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes
that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to
your knees and make ready.


CLAUDIO

Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love
with life that I will sue to be rid of it.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Hold you there: farewell.
Exit CLAUDIO
Provost, a word with you!
Re-enter Provost


Provost

What's your will, father


DUKE VINCENTIO

That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me
awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my
habit no loss shall touch her by my company.


Provost

In good time.
Exit Provost. ISABELLA comes forward


DUKE VINCENTIO

The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:
the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty
brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of
your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever
fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,
fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but
that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should
wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this
substitute, and to save your brother?


ISABELLA

I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my
brother die by the law than my son should be
unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke
deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can
speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or
discover his government.


DUKE VINCENTIO

That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter
now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made
trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my
advisings: to the love I have in doing good a
remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe
that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged
lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from
the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious
person; and much please the absent duke, if
peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of
this business.


ISABELLA

Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do
anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have
you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of
Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?


ISABELLA

I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.


DUKE VINCENTIO

She should this Angelo have married; was affianced
to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between
which time of the contract and limit of the
solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,
having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the
poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and
renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most
kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of
her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her
combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.


ISABELLA

Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?


DUKE VINCENTIO

Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them
with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,
pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,
bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet
wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,
is washed with them, but relents not.


ISABELLA

What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid
from the world! What corruption in this life, that
it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?


DUKE VINCENTIO

It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the
cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps
you from dishonour in doing it.


ISABELLA

Show me how, good father.


DUKE VINCENTIO

This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance
of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that
in all reason should have quenched her love, hath,
like an impediment in the current, made it more
violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his
requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with
his demands to the point; only refer yourself to
this advantage, first, that your stay with him may
not be long; that the time may have all shadow and
silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.
This being granted in course,--and now follows
all,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up
your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter
acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to
her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother
saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana
advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid
will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you
think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness
of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.
What think you of it?


ISABELLA

The image of it gives me content already; and I
trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.


DUKE VINCENTIO

It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily
to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his
bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will
presently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moated
grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that
place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that
it may be quickly.


ISABELLA

I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.
Exeunt severally

SCENE II. The street before the prison.

Enter, on one side, DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before; on the other, ELBOW, and Officers with POMPEY


ELBOW

Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will
needs buy and sell men and women like beasts, we
shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard.


DUKE VINCENTIO

O heavens! what stuff is here


POMPEY

'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the
merriest was put down, and the worser allowed by
order of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and
furred with fox and lamb-skins too, to signify, that
craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing.


ELBOW

Come your way, sir. 'Bless you, good father friar.


DUKE VINCENTIO

And you, good brother father. What offence hath
this man made you, sir?


ELBOW

Marry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, we
take him to be a thief too, sir; for we have found
upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have
sent to the deputy.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!
The evil that thou causest to be done,
That is thy means to live. Do thou but think
What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
From such a filthy vice: say to thyself,
From their abominable and beastly touches
I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.
Canst thou believe thy living is a life,
So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.


POMPEY

Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet,
sir, I would prove--


DUKE VINCENTIO

Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,
Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:
Correction and instruction must both work
Ere this rude beast will profit.


ELBOW

He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him
warning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: if
he be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he were
as good go a mile on his errand.


DUKE VINCENTIO

That we were all, as some would seem to be,
From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!


ELBOW

His neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir.


POMPEY

I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman and a
friend of mine.
Enter LUCIO


LUCIO

How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of
Caesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is there
none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be
had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and
extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
sayest thou to this tune, matter and method? Is't
not drowned i' the last rain, ha? What sayest
thou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is
the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The
trick of it?


DUKE VINCENTIO

Still thus, and thus; still worse!


LUCIO

How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she
still, ha?


POMPEY

Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she
is herself in the tub.


LUCIO

Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be
so: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:
an unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going
to prison, Pompey?


POMPEY

Yes, faith, sir.


LUCIO

Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say I
sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?


ELBOW

For being a bawd, for being a bawd.


LUCIO

Well, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be the
due of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is he
doubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born.
Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,
Pompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; you
will keep the house.


POMPEY

I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.


LUCIO

No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear.
I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If
you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the
more. Adieu, trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, friar.


DUKE VINCENTIO

And you.


LUCIO

Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?


ELBOW

Come your ways, sir; come.


POMPEY

You will not bail me, then, sir?


LUCIO

Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?
what news?


ELBOW

Come your ways, sir; come.


LUCIO

Go to kennel, Pompey; go.
Exeunt ELBOW, POMPEY and Officers
What news, friar, of the duke?


DUKE VINCENTIO

I know none. Can you tell me of any?


LUCIO

Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other
some, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?


DUKE VINCENTIO

I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.


LUCIO

It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from
the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born
to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he
puts transgression to 't.


DUKE VINCENTIO

He does well in 't.


LUCIO

A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in
him: something too crabbed that way, friar.


DUKE VINCENTIO

It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.


LUCIO

Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;
it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp
it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put
down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and
woman after this downright way of creation: is it
true, think you?


DUKE VINCENTIO

How should he be made, then?


LUCIO

Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he
was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is
certain that when he makes water his urine is
congealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is a
motion generative; that's infallible.


DUKE VINCENTIO

You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.


LUCIO

Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the
rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a
man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?
Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a
hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing
a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he
knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.


DUKE VINCENTIO

I never heard the absent duke much detected for
women; he was not inclined that way.


LUCIO

O, sir, you are deceived.


DUKE VINCENTIO

'Tis not possible.


LUCIO

Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and
his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the
duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too;
that let me inform you.


DUKE VINCENTIO

You do him wrong, surely.


LUCIO

Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the
duke: and I believe I know the cause of his
withdrawing.


DUKE VINCENTIO

What, I prithee, might be the cause?


LUCIO

No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the
teeth and the lips: but this I can let you
understand, the greater file of the subject held the
duke to be wise.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Wise! why, no question but he was.


LUCIO

A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:
the very stream of his life and the business he hath
helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better
proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own
bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the
envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.
Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your
knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.


LUCIO

Sir, I know him, and I love him.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with
dearer love.


LUCIO

Come, sir, I know what I know.


DUKE VINCENTIO

I can hardly believe that, since you know not what
you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our
prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your
answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,
you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call
upon you; and, I pray you, your name?


LUCIO

Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.


DUKE VINCENTIO

He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to
report you.


LUCIO

I fear you not.


DUKE VINCENTIO

O, you hope the duke will return no more; or you
imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I
can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.


LUCIO

I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,
friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if
Claudio die to-morrow or no?


DUKE VINCENTIO

Why should he die, sir?


LUCIO

Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would
the duke we talk of were returned again: the
ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with
continency; sparrows must not build in his
house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke
yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would
never bring them to light: would he were returned!
Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.
Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The
duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on
Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,
he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown
bread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.
Exit


DUKE VINCENTIO

No might nor greatness in mortality
Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny
The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong
Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?
But who comes here?
Enter ESCALUS, Provost, and Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE


ESCALUS

Go; away with her to prison!


MISTRESS OVERDONE

Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounted
a merciful man; good my lord.


ESCALUS

Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in
the same kind! This would make mercy swear and play
the tyrant.


Provost

A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please
your honour.


MISTRESS OVERDONE

My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.
Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the
duke's time; he promised her marriage: his child
is a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob:
I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!


ESCALUS

That fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him be
called before us. Away with her to prison! Go to;
no more words.
Exeunt Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE
Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered;
Claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished
with divines, and have all charitable preparation.
if my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be
so with him.


Provost

So please you, this friar hath been with him, and
advised him for the entertainment of death.


ESCALUS

Good even, good father.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Bliss and goodness on you!


ESCALUS

Of whence are you?


DUKE VINCENTIO

Not of this country, though my chance is now
To use it for my time: I am a brother
Of gracious order, late come from the See
In special business from his holiness.


ESCALUS

What news abroad i' the world?


DUKE VINCENTIO

None, but that there is so great a fever on
goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it:
novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous
to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous
to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce
truth enough alive to make societies secure; but
security enough to make fellowships accurst: much
upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This
news is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I
pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?


ESCALUS

One that, above all other strifes, contended
especially to know himself.


DUKE VINCENTIO

What pleasure was he given to?


ESCALUS

Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at
any thing which professed to make him rejoice: a
gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to
his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous;
and let me desire to know how you find Claudio
prepared. I am made to understand that you have
lent him visitation.


DUKE VINCENTIO

He professes to have received no sinister measure
from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself
to the determination of justice: yet had he framed
to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many
deceiving promises of life; which I by my good
leisure have discredited to him, and now is he
resolved to die.


ESCALUS

You have paid the heavens your function, and the
prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have
laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest
shore of my modesty: but my brother justice have I
found so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him
he is indeed Justice.


DUKE VINCENTIO

If his own life answer the straitness of his
proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he
chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.


ESCALUS

I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Peace be with you!
Exeunt ESCALUS and Provost
He who the sword of heaven will bear
Should be as holy as severe;
Pattern in himself to know,
Grace to stand, and virtue go;
More nor less to others paying
Than by self-offences weighing.
Shame to him whose cruel striking
Kills for faults of his own liking!
Twice treble shame on Angelo,
To weed my vice and let his grow!
O, what may man within him hide,
Though angel on the outward side!
How may likeness made in crimes,
Making practise on the times,
To draw with idle spiders' strings
Most ponderous and substantial things!
Craft against vice I must apply:
With Angelo to-night shall lie
His old betrothed but despised;
So disguise shall, by the disguised,
Pay with falsehood false exacting,
And perform an old contracting.
Exit

ACT IV
SCENE I. The moated grange at ST. LUKE's.

Enter MARIANA and a Boy


Boy sings


Take, O, take those lips away,
That so sweetly were forsworn;
And those eyes, the break of day,
Lights that do mislead the morn:
But my kisses bring again, bring again;
Seals of love, but sealed in vain, sealed in vain.


MARIANA

Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away:
Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice
Hath often still'd my brawling discontent.
Exit Boy
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before
I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish
You had not found me here so musical:
Let me excuse me, and believe me so,
My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.


DUKE VINCENTIO

'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm
To make bad good, and good provoke to harm.
I pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquired
for me here to-day? much upon this time have
I promised here to meet.


MARIANA

You have not been inquired after:
I have sat here all day.
Enter ISABELLA


DUKE VINCENTIO

I do constantly believe you. The time is come even
now. I shall crave your forbearance a little: may
be I will call upon you anon, for some advantage to yourself.


MARIANA

I am always bound to you.
Exit


DUKE VINCENTIO

Very well met, and well come.
What is the news from this good deputy?


ISABELLA

He hath a garden circummured with brick,
Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;
And to that vineyard is a planched gate,
That makes his opening with this bigger key:
This other doth command a little door
Which from the vineyard to the garden leads;
There have I made my promise
Upon the heavy middle of the night
To call upon him.


DUKE VINCENTIO

But shall you on your knowledge find this way?


ISABELLA

I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:
With whispering and most guilty diligence,
In action all of precept, he did show me
The way twice o'er.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Are there no other tokens
Between you 'greed concerning her observance?


ISABELLA

No, none, but only a repair i' the dark;
And that I have possess'd him my most stay
Can be but brief; for I have made him know
I have a servant comes with me along,
That stays upon me, whose persuasion is
I come about my brother.


DUKE VINCENTIO

'Tis well borne up.
I have not yet made known to Mariana
A word of this. What, ho! within! come forth!
Re-enter MARIANA
I pray you, be acquainted with this maid;
She comes to do you good.


ISABELLA

I do desire the like.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?


MARIANA

Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Take, then, this your companion by the hand,
Who hath a story ready for your ear.
I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;
The vaporous night approaches.


MARIANA

Will't please you walk aside?
Exeunt MARIANA and ISABELLA


DUKE VINCENTIO

O place and greatness! millions of false eyes
Are stuck upon thee: volumes of report
Run with these false and most contrarious quests
Upon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit
Make thee the father of their idle dreams
And rack thee in their fancies.
Re-enter MARIANA and ISABELLA
Welcome, how agreed?


ISABELLA

She'll take the enterprise upon her, father,
If you advise it.


DUKE VINCENTIO

                  It is not my consent,
But my entreaty too.


ISABELLA

Little have you to say
When you depart from him, but, soft and low,
'Remember now my brother.'


MARIANA

Fear me not.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.
He is your husband on a pre-contract:
To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,
Sith that the justice of your title to him
Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go:
Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.
Exeunt

SCENE II. A room in the prison.

Enter Provost and POMPEY


Provost

Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?


POMPEY

If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a
married man, he's his wife's head, and I can never
cut off a woman's head.


Provost

Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a
direct answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio
and Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common
executioner, who in his office lacks a helper: if
you will take it on you to assist him, it shall
redeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall have
your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance
with an unpitied whipping, for you have been a
notorious bawd.


POMPEY

Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;
but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I
would be glad to receive some instruction from my
fellow partner.


Provost

What, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there?
Enter ABHORSON


ABHORSON

Do you call, sir?


Provost

Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in
your execution. If you think it meet, compound with
him by the year, and let him abide here with you; if
not, use him for the present and dismiss him. He
cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd.


ABHORSON

A bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery.


Provost

Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn
the scale.
Exit


POMPEY

Pray, sir, by your good favour,--for surely, sir, a
good favour you have, but that you have a hanging
look,--do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?


ABHORSON

Ay, sir; a mystery


POMPEY

Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and
your whores, sir, being members of my occupation,
using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery:
but what mystery there should be in hanging, if I
should be hanged, I cannot imagine.


ABHORSON

Sir, it is a mystery.


POMPEY

Proof?


ABHORSON

Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be
too little for your thief, your true man thinks it
big enough; if it be too big for your thief, your
thief thinks it little enough: so every true man's
apparel fits your thief.
Re-enter Provost


Provost

Are you agreed?


POMPEY

Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is
a more penitent trade than your bawd; he doth
oftener ask forgiveness.


Provost

You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe
to-morrow four o'clock.


ABHORSON

Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.


POMPEY

I do desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you have
occasion to use me for your own turn, you shall find
me yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness I owe you
a good turn.


Provost

Call hither Barnardine and Claudio:
Exeunt POMPEY and ABHORSON
The one has my pity; not a jot the other,
Being a murderer, though he were my brother.
Enter CLAUDIO
Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:
'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow
Thou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?


CLAUDIO

As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour
When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:
He will not wake.


Provost

                  Who can do good on him?
Well, go, prepare yourself.
Knocking within
But, hark, what noise?
Heaven give your spirits comfort!
Exit CLAUDIO
By and by.
I hope it is some pardon or reprieve
For the most gentle Claudio.
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before
Welcome father.


DUKE VINCENTIO

The best and wholesomest spirts of the night
Envelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?


Provost

None, since the curfew rung.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Not Isabel?


Provost

          No.


DUKE VINCENTIO

                  They will, then, ere't be long.


Provost

What comfort is for Claudio?


DUKE VINCENTIO

There's some in hope.


Provost

It is a bitter deputy.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd
Even with the stroke and line of his great justice:
He doth with holy abstinence subdue
That in himself which he spurs on his power
To qualify in others: were he meal'd with that
Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;
But this being so, he's just.
Knocking within
Now are they come.
Exit Provost
This is a gentle provost: seldom when
The steeled gaoler is the friend of men.
Knocking within
How now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with haste
That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.
Re-enter Provost


Provost

There he must stay until the officer
Arise to let him in: he is call'd up.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,
But he must die to-morrow?


Provost

None, sir, none.


DUKE VINCENTIO

As near the dawning, provost, as it is,
You shall hear more ere morning.


Provost

Happily
You something know; yet I believe there comes
No countermand; no such example have we:
Besides, upon the very siege of justice
Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
Profess'd the contrary.
Enter a Messenger
This is his lordship's man.


DUKE VINCENTIO

And here comes Claudio's pardon.


Messenger

[Giving a paper]
My lord hath sent you this note; and by me this
further charge, that you swerve not from the
smallest article of it, neither in time, matter, or
other circumstance. Good morrow; for, as I take it,
it is almost day.


Provost

I shall obey him.
Exit Messenger


DUKE VINCENTIO

[Aside]  This is his pardon, purchased by such sin
For which the pardoner himself is in.
Hence hath offence his quick celerity,
When it is born in high authority:
When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended,
That for the fault's love is the offender friended.
Now, sir, what news?


Provost

I told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss
in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted
putting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Pray you, let's hear.


Provost

[Reads]
'Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, let
Claudio be executed by four of the clock; and in the
afternoon Barnardine: for my better satisfaction,
let me have Claudio's head sent me by five. Let
this be duly performed; with a thought that more
depends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus fail
not to do your office, as you will answer it at your peril.'
What say you to this, sir?


DUKE VINCENTIO

What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the
afternoon?


Provost

A Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; one
that is a prisoner nine years old.


DUKE VINCENTIO

How came it that the absent duke had not either
delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I
have heard it was ever his manner to do so.


Provost

His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,
indeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord
Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.


DUKE VINCENTIO

It is now apparent?


Provost

Most manifest, and not denied by himself.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Hath he born himself penitently in prison? how
seems he to be touched?


Provost

A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but
as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless
of what's past, present, or to come; insensible of
mortality, and desperately mortal.


DUKE VINCENTIO

He wants advice.


Provost

He will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty
of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he
would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days
entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if
to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming
warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.


DUKE VINCENTIO

More of him anon. There is written in your brow,
provost, honesty and constancy: if I read it not
truly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the
boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.
Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is
no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath
sentenced him. To make you understand this in a
manifested effect, I crave but four days' respite;
for the which you are to do me both a present and a
dangerous courtesy.


Provost

Pray, sir, in what?


DUKE VINCENTIO

In the delaying death.


Provost

A lack, how may I do it, having the hour limited,
and an express command, under penalty, to deliver
his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case
as Claudio's, to cross this in the smallest.


DUKE VINCENTIO

By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my
instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine
be this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo.


Provost

Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.


DUKE VINCENTIO

O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.
Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was
the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his
death: you know the course is common. If any thing
fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good
fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead
against it with my life.


Provost

Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?


Provost

To him, and to his substitutes.


DUKE VINCENTIO

You will think you have made no offence, if the duke
avouch the justice of your dealing?


Provost

But what likelihood is in that?


DUKE VINCENTIO

Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see
you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor
persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go
further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.
Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the
duke: you know the character, I doubt not; and the
signet is not strange to you.


Provost

I know them both.


DUKE VINCENTIO

The contents of this is the return of the duke: you
shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you
shall find, within these two days he will be here.
This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this
very day receives letters of strange tenor;
perchance of the duke's death; perchance entering
into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what
is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the
shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these
things should be: all difficulties are but easy
when they are known. Call your executioner, and off
with Barnardine's head: I will give him a present
shrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you
are amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you.
Come away; it is almost clear dawn.
Exeunt

SCENE III. Another room in the same.

Enter POMPEY


POMPEY

I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house
of profession: one would think it were Mistress
Overdone's own house, for here be many of her old
customers. First, here's young Master Rash; he's in
for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,
ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he made
five marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was not
much in request, for the old women were all dead.
Then is there here one Master Caper, at the suit of
Master Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits of
peach-coloured satin, which now peaches him a
beggar. Then have we here young Dizy, and young
Master Deep-vow, and Master Copperspur, and Master
Starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and young
Drop-heir that killed lusty Pudding, and Master
Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shooty the
great traveller, and wild Half-can that stabbed
Pots, and, I think, forty more; all great doers in
our trade, and are now 'for the Lord's sake.'
Enter ABHORSON


ABHORSON

Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.


POMPEY

Master Barnardine! you must rise and be hanged.
Master Barnardine!


ABHORSON

What, ho, Barnardine!


BARNARDINE

[Within]  A pox o' your throats! Who makes that
noise there? What are you?


POMPEY

Your friends, sir; the hangman. You must be so
good, sir, to rise and be put to death.


BARNARDINE

[Within]  Away, you rogue, away! I am sleepy.


ABHORSON

Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.


POMPEY

Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are
executed, and sleep afterwards.


ABHORSON

Go in to him, and fetch him out.


POMPEY

He is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle.


ABHORSON

Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?


POMPEY

Very ready, sir.
Enter BARNARDINE


BARNARDINE

How now, Abhorson? what's the news with you?


ABHORSON

Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your
prayers; for, look you, the warrant's come.


BARNARDINE

You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not
fitted for 't.


POMPEY

O, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night,
and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep the
sounder all the next day.


ABHORSON

Look you, sir; here comes your ghostly father: do
we jest now, think you?
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before


DUKE VINCENTIO

Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily
you are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort
you and pray with you.


BARNARDINE

Friar, not I	I have been drinking hard all night,
and I will have more time to prepare me, or they
shall beat out my brains with billets: I will not
consent to die this day, that's certain.


DUKE VINCENTIO

O, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech you
Look forward on the journey you shall go.


BARNARDINE

I swear I will not die to-day for any man's
persuasion.


DUKE VINCENTIO

But hear you.


BARNARDINE

Not a word: if you have any thing to say to me,
come to my ward; for thence will not I to-day.
Exit


DUKE VINCENTIO

Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!
After him, fellows; bring him to the block.
Exeunt ABHORSON and POMPEY
Re-enter Provost


Provost

Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?


DUKE VINCENTIO

A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;
And to transport him in the mind he is
Were damnable.


Provost

                  Here in the prison, father,
There died this morning of a cruel fever
One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,
A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
Just of his colour. What if we do omit
This reprobate till he were well inclined;
And satisfy the deputy with the visage
Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?


DUKE VINCENTIO

O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!
Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on
Prefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,
And sent according to command; whiles I
Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.


Provost

This shall be done, good father, presently.
But Barnardine must die this afternoon:
And how shall we continue Claudio,
To save me from the danger that might come
If he were known alive?


DUKE VINCENTIO

Let this be done.
Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio:
Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
To the under generation, you shall find
Your safety manifested.


Provost

I am your free dependant.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.
Exit Provost
Now will I write letters to Angelo,--
The provost, he shall bear them, whose contents
Shall witness to him I am near at home,
And that, by great injunctions, I am bound
To enter publicly: him I'll desire
To meet me at the consecrated fount
A league below the city; and from thence,
By cold gradation and well-balanced form,
We shall proceed with Angelo.
Re-enter Provost


Provost

Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Convenient is it. Make a swift return;
For I would commune with you of such things
That want no ear but yours.


Provost

I'll make all speed.
Exit


ISABELLA

[Within]  Peace, ho, be here!


DUKE VINCENTIO

The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know
If yet her brother's pardon be come hither:
But I will keep her ignorant of her good,
To make her heavenly comforts of despair,
When it is least expected.
Enter ISABELLA


ISABELLA

Ho, by your leave!


DUKE VINCENTIO

Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.


ISABELLA

The better, given me by so holy a man.
Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?


DUKE VINCENTIO

He hath released him, Isabel, from the world:
His head is off and sent to Angelo.


ISABELLA

Nay, but it is not so.


DUKE VINCENTIO

It is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,
In your close patience.


ISABELLA

O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!


DUKE VINCENTIO

You shall not be admitted to his sight.


ISABELLA

Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!
Injurious world! most damned Angelo!


DUKE VINCENTIO

This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;
Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.
Mark what I say, which you shall find
By every syllable a faithful verity:
The duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes;
One of our convent, and his confessor,
Gives me this instance: already he hath carried
Notice to Escalus and Angelo,
Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,
There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom
In that good path that I would wish it go,
And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,
Grace of the duke, revenges to your heart,
And general honour.


ISABELLA

                  I am directed by you.


DUKE VINCENTIO

This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;
'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:
Say, by this token, I desire his company
At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours
I'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you
Before the duke, and to the head of Angelo
Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,
I am combined by a sacred vow
And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:
Command these fretting waters from your eyes
With a light heart; trust not my holy order,
If I pervert your course. Who's here?
Enter LUCIO


LUCIO

Good even. Friar, where's the provost?


DUKE VINCENTIO

Not within, sir.


LUCIO

O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see
thine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fain
to dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not for
my head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set
me to 't. But they say the duke will be here
to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother:
if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been
at home, he had lived.
Exit ISABELLA


DUKE VINCENTIO

Sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to your
reports; but the best is, he lives not in them.


LUCIO

Friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do:
he's a better woodman than thou takest him for.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.


LUCIO

Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee
I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.


DUKE VINCENTIO

You have told me too many of him already, sir, if
they be true; if not true, none were enough.


LUCIO

I was once before him for getting a wench with child.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Did you such a thing?


LUCIO

Yes, marry, did I	but I was fain to forswear it;
they would else have married me to the rotten medlar.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.


LUCIO

By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end:
if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little of
it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick.
Exeunt

SCENE IV. A room in ANGELO's house.

Enter ANGELO and ESCALUS


ESCALUS

Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.


ANGELO

In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions
show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be
not tainted! And why meet him at the gates, and
redeliver our authorities there


ESCALUS

I guess not.


ANGELO

And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
entering, that if any crave redress of injustice,
they should exhibit their petitions in the street?


ESCALUS

He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of
complaints, and to deliver us from devices
hereafter, which shall then have no power to stand
against us.


ANGELO

Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes
i' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give
notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet
him.


ESCALUS

I shall, sir. Fare you well.


ANGELO

Good night.
Exit ESCALUS
This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant
And dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!
And by an eminent body that enforced
The law against it! But that her tender shame
Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,
How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;
For my authority bears of a credent bulk,
That no particular scandal once can touch
But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,
Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,
Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,
By so receiving a dishonour'd life
With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!
A lack, when once our grace we have forgot,
Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.
Exit

SCENE V. Fields without the town.

Enter DUKE VINCENTIO in his own habit, and FRIAR PETER


DUKE VINCENTIO

These letters at fit time deliver me
Giving letters
The provost knows our purpose and our plot.
The matter being afoot, keep your instruction,
And hold you ever to our special drift;
Though sometimes you do blench from this to that,
As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house,
And tell him where I stay: give the like notice
To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,
And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;
But send me Flavius first.


FRIAR PETER

It shall be speeded well.
Exit
Enter VARRIUS


DUKE VINCENTIO

I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste:
Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends
Will greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius.
Exeunt

SCENE VI. Street near the city gate.

Enter ISABELLA and MARIANA


ISABELLA

To speak so indirectly I am loath:
I would say the truth; but to accuse him so,
That is your part: yet I am advised to do it;
He says, to veil full purpose.


MARIANA

Be ruled by him.


ISABELLA

Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure
He speak against me on the adverse side,
I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic
That's bitter to sweet end.


MARIANA

I would Friar Peter--


ISABELLA

O, peace! the friar is come.
Enter FRIAR PETER


FRIAR PETER

Come, I have found you out a stand most fit,
Where you may have such vantage on the duke,
He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded;
The generous and gravest citizens
Have hent the gates, and very near upon
The duke is entering: therefore, hence, away!
Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. The city gate.

MARIANA veiled, ISABELLA, and FRIAR PETER, at their  stand. Enter DUKE VINCENTIO, VARRIUS, Lords,  ANGELO, ESCALUS, LUCIO, Provost, Officers, and Citizens, at several doors


DUKE VINCENTIO

My very worthy cousin, fairly met!
Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.


ANGELO

ESCALUS

Happy return be to your royal grace!


DUKE VINCENTIO

Many and hearty thankings to you both.
We have made inquiry of you; and we hear
Such goodness of your justice, that our soul
Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,
Forerunning more requital.


ANGELO

You make my bonds still greater.


DUKE VINCENTIO

O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,
To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,
When it deserves, with characters of brass,
A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,
And let the subject see, to make them know
That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,
You must walk by us on our other hand;
And good supporters are you.
FRIAR PETER and ISABELLA come forward


FRIAR PETER

Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.


ISABELLA

Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard
Upon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!
O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye
By throwing it on any other object
Till you have heard me in my true complaint
And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!


DUKE VINCENTIO

Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.
Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:
Reveal yourself to him.


ISABELLA

O worthy duke,
You bid me seek redemption of the devil:
Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak
Must either punish me, not being believed,
Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!


ANGELO

My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:
She hath been a suitor to me for her brother
Cut off by course of justice,--


ISABELLA

By course of justice!


ANGELO

And she will speak most bitterly and strange.


ISABELLA

Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:
That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?
That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?
That Angelo is an adulterous thief,
An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;
Is it not strange and strange?


DUKE VINCENTIO

Nay, it is ten times strange.


ISABELLA

It is not truer he is Angelo
Than this is all as true as it is strange:
Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
To the end of reckoning.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Away with her! Poor soul,
She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.


ISABELLA

O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest
There is another comfort than this world,
That thou neglect me not, with that opinion
That I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible
That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible
But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,
May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute
As Angelo; even so may Angelo,
In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,
Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:
If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,
Had I more name for badness.


DUKE VINCENTIO

By mine honesty,
If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--
Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
Such a dependency of thing on thing,
As e'er I heard in madness.


ISABELLA

O gracious duke,
Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason
For inequality; but let your reason serve
To make the truth appear where it seems hid,
And hide the false seems true.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Many that are not mad
Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?


ISABELLA

I am the sister of one Claudio,
Condemn'd upon the act of fornication
To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:
I, in probation of a sisterhood,
Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio
As then the messenger,--


LUCIO

That's I, an't like your grace:
I came to her from Claudio, and desired her
To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
For her poor brother's pardon.


ISABELLA

That's he indeed.


DUKE VINCENTIO

You were not bid to speak.


LUCIO

No, my good lord;
Nor wish'd to hold my peace.


DUKE VINCENTIO

I wish you now, then;
Pray you, take note of it: and when you have
A business for yourself, pray heaven you then
Be perfect.


LUCIO

I warrant your honour.


DUKE VINCENTIO

The warrants for yourself; take heed to't.


ISABELLA

This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--


LUCIO

Right.


DUKE VINCENTIO

It may be right; but you are i' the wrong
To speak before your time. Proceed.


ISABELLA

I went
To this pernicious caitiff deputy,--


DUKE VINCENTIO

That's somewhat madly spoken.


ISABELLA

Pardon it;
The phrase is to the matter.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Mended again. The matter; proceed.


ISABELLA

In brief, to set the needless process by,
How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--
For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion
I now begin with grief and shame to utter:
He would not, but by gift of my chaste body
To his concupiscible intemperate lust,
Release my brother; and, after much debatement,
My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,
And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,
His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant
For my poor brother's head.


DUKE VINCENTIO

This is most likely!


ISABELLA

O, that it were as like as it is true!


DUKE VINCENTIO

By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st,
Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
In hateful practise. First, his integrity
Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason
That with such vehemency he should pursue
Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended,
He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself
And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:
Confess the truth, and say by whose advice
Thou camest here to complain.


ISABELLA

And is this all?
Then, O you blessed ministers above,
Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time
Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,
As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!


DUKE VINCENTIO

I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!
To prison with her! Shall we thus permit
A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
On him so near us? This needs must be a practise.
Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?


ISABELLA

One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.


DUKE VINCENTIO

A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?


LUCIO

My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;
I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord
For certain words he spake against your grace
In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Words against me? this is a good friar, belike!
And to set on this wretched woman here
Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.


LUCIO

But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,
I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,
A very scurvy fellow.


FRIAR PETER

Blessed be your royal grace!
I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard
Your royal ear abused. First, hath this woman
Most wrongfully accused your substitute,
Who is as free from touch or soil with her
As she from one ungot.


DUKE VINCENTIO

We did believe no less.
Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?


FRIAR PETER

I know him for a man divine and holy;
Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,
As he's reported by this gentleman;
And, on my trust, a man that never yet
Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace.


LUCIO

My lord, most villanously; believe it.


FRIAR PETER

Well, he in time may come to clear himself;
But at this instant he is sick my lord,
Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,
Being come to knowledge that there was complaint
Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,
To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know
Is true and false; and what he with his oath
And all probation will make up full clear,
Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman.
To justify this worthy nobleman,
So vulgarly and personally accused,
Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,
Till she herself confess it.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Good friar, let's hear it.
ISABELLA is carried off guarded; and MARIANA comes forward
Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?
O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!
Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;
In this I'll be impartial; be you judge
Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?
First, let her show her face, and after speak.


MARIANA

Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face
Until my husband bid me.


DUKE VINCENTIO

What, are you married?


MARIANA

No, my lord.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Are you a maid?


MARIANA

No, my lord.


DUKE VINCENTIO

A widow, then?


MARIANA

Neither, my lord.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?


LUCIO

My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are
neither maid, widow, nor wife.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause
To prattle for himself.


LUCIO

Well, my lord.


MARIANA

My lord; I do confess I ne'er was married;
And I confess besides I am no maid:
I have known my husband; yet my husband
Knows not that ever he knew me.


LUCIO

He was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better.


DUKE VINCENTIO

For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!


LUCIO

Well, my lord.


DUKE VINCENTIO

This is no witness for Lord Angelo.


MARIANA

Now I come to't my lord
She that accuses him of fornication,
In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,
And charges him my lord, with such a time
When I'll depose I had him in mine arms
With all the effect of love.


ANGELO

Charges she more than me?


MARIANA

Not that I know.


DUKE VINCENTIO

No? you say your husband.


MARIANA

Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,
Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,
But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.


ANGELO

This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.


MARIANA

My husband bids me; now I will unmask.
Unveiling
This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,
Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;
This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,
Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body
That took away the match from Isabel,
And did supply thee at thy garden-house
In her imagined person.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Know you this woman?


LUCIO

Carnally, she says.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Sirrah, no more!


LUCIO

Enough, my lord.


ANGELO

My lord, I must confess I know this woman:
And five years since there was some speech of marriage
Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,
Partly for that her promised proportions
Came short of composition, but in chief
For that her reputation was disvalued
In levity: since which time of five years
I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,
Upon my faith and honour.


MARIANA

Noble prince,
As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,
As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,
I am affianced this man's wife as strongly
As words could make up vows: and, my good lord,
But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house
He knew me as a wife. As this is true,
Let me in safety raise me from my knees
Or else for ever be confixed here,
A marble monument!


ANGELO

                  I did but smile till now:
Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice
My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive
These poor informal women are no more
But instruments of some more mightier member
That sets them on: let me have way, my lord,
To find this practise out.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Ay, with my heart
And punish them to your height of pleasure.
Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,
Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,
Though they would swear down each particular saint,
Were testimonies against his worth and credit
That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,
Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.
There is another friar that set them on;
Let him be sent for.


FRIAR PETER

Would he were here, my lord! for he indeed
Hath set the women on to this complaint:
Your provost knows the place where he abides
And he may fetch him.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Go do it instantly.
Exit Provost
And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,
Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,
Do with your injuries as seems you best,
In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;
But stir not you till you have well determined
Upon these slanderers.


ESCALUS

My lord, we'll do it throughly.
Exit DUKE
Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that
Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?


LUCIO

'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing
but in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most
villanous speeches of the duke.


ESCALUS

We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and
enforce them against him: we shall find this friar a
notable fellow.


LUCIO

As any in Vienna, on my word.


ESCALUS

Call that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with her.
Exit an Attendant
Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you
shall see how I'll handle her.


LUCIO

Not better than he, by her own report.


ESCALUS

Say you?


LUCIO

Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately,
she would sooner confess: perchance, publicly,
she'll be ashamed.


ESCALUS

I will go darkly to work with her.


LUCIO

That's the way; for women are light at midnight.
Re-enter Officers with ISABELLA; and Provost with the DUKE VINCENTIO in his friar's habit


ESCALUS

Come on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies all
that you have said.


LUCIO

My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of; here with
the provost.


ESCALUS

In very good time: speak not you to him till we
call upon you.


LUCIO

Mum.


ESCALUS

Come, sir: did you set these women on to slander
Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did.


DUKE VINCENTIO

'Tis false.


ESCALUS

How! know you where you are?


DUKE VINCENTIO

Respect to your great place! and let the devil
Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!
Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.


ESCALUS

The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:
Look you speak justly.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,
Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?
Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?
Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,
Thus to retort your manifest appeal,
And put your trial in the villain's mouth
Which here you come to accuse.


LUCIO

This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.


ESCALUS

Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,
Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth
And in the witness of his proper ear,
To call him villain? and then to glance from him
To the duke himself, to tax him with injustice?
Take him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse you
Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.
What 'unjust'!


DUKE VINCENTIO

                  Be not so hot; the duke
Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
Dare rack his own: his subject am I not,
Nor here provincial. My business in this state
Made me a looker on here in Vienna,
Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
Till it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults,
But faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes
Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
As much in mock as mark.


ESCALUS

Slander to the state! Away with him to prison!


ANGELO

What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?
Is this the man that you did tell us of?


LUCIO

'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman baldpate:
do you know me?


DUKE VINCENTIO

I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: I
met you at the prison, in the absence of the duke.


LUCIO

O, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the duke?


DUKE VINCENTIO

Most notedly, sir.


LUCIO

Do you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger, a
fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?


DUKE VINCENTIO

You must, sir, change persons with me, ere you make
that my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; and
much more, much worse.


LUCIO

O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the
nose for thy speeches?


DUKE VINCENTIO

I protest I love the duke as I love myself.


ANGELO

Hark, how the villain would close now, after his
treasonable abuses!


ESCALUS

Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with
him to prison! Where is the provost? Away with him
to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him
speak no more. Away with those giglots too, and
with the other confederate companion!


DUKE VINCENTIO

[To Provost]  Stay, sir; stay awhile.


ANGELO

What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.


LUCIO

Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you
bald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, must
you? Show your knave's visage, with a pox to you!
show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!
Will't not off?
Pulls off the friar's hood, and discovers DUKE VINCENTIO


DUKE VINCENTIO

Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.
First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.
To LUCIO
Sneak not away, sir; for the friar and you
Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him.


LUCIO

This may prove worse than hanging.


DUKE VINCENTIO

[To ESCALUS]  What you have spoke I pardon: sit you down:
We'll borrow place of him.
To ANGELO
Sir, by your leave.
Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence,
That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,
Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
And hold no longer out.


ANGELO

O my dread lord,
I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,
To think I can be undiscernible,
When I perceive your grace, like power divine,
Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,
No longer session hold upon my shame,
But let my trial be mine own confession:
Immediate sentence then and sequent death
Is all the grace I beg.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Come hither, Mariana.
Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?


ANGELO

I was, my lord.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Go take her hence, and marry her instantly.
Do you the office, friar; which consummate,
Return him here again. Go with him, provost.
Exeunt ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER and Provost


ESCALUS

My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour
Than at the strangeness of it.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Come hither, Isabel.
Your friar is now your prince: as I was then
Advertising and holy to your business,
Not changing heart with habit, I am still
Attorney'd at your service.


ISABELLA

O, give me pardon,
That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd
Your unknown sovereignty!


DUKE VINCENTIO

You are pardon'd, Isabel:
And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.
Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;
And you may marvel why I obscured myself,
Labouring to save his life, and would not rather
Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
It was the swift celerity of his death,
Which I did think with slower foot came on,
That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him!
That life is better life, past fearing death,
Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,
So happy is your brother.


ISABELLA

I do, my lord.
Re-enter ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER, and Provost


DUKE VINCENTIO

For this new-married man approaching here,
Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
Your well defended honour, you must pardon
For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,--
Being criminal, in double violation
Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach
Thereon dependent, for your brother's life,--
The very mercy of the law cries out
Most audible, even from his proper tongue,
'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'
Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;
Like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.
Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;
Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.
We do condemn thee to the very block
Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.
Away with him!


MARIANA

                  O my most gracious lord,
I hope you will not mock me with a husband.


DUKE VINCENTIO

It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.
Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,
I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,
For that he knew you, might reproach your life
And choke your good to come; for his possessions,
Although by confiscation they are ours,
We do instate and widow you withal,
To buy you a better husband.


MARIANA

O my dear lord,
I crave no other, nor no better man.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Never crave him; we are definitive.


MARIANA

Gentle my liege,--
Kneeling


DUKE VINCENTIO

                  You do but lose your labour.
Away with him to death!
To LUCIO
Now, sir, to you.


MARIANA

O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;
Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
I'll lend you all my life to do you service.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Against all sense you do importune her:
Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,
And take her hence in horror.


MARIANA

Isabel,
Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;
Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.
They say, best men are moulded out of faults;
And, for the most, become much more the better
For being a little bad: so may my husband.
O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?


DUKE VINCENTIO

He dies for Claudio's death.


ISABELLA

Most bounteous sir,
Kneeling
Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
As if my brother lived: I partly think
A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,
Till he did look on me: since it is so,
Let him not die. My brother had but justice,
In that he did the thing for which he died:
For Angelo,
His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,
And must be buried but as an intent
That perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects;
Intents but merely thoughts.


MARIANA

Merely, my lord.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.
I have bethought me of another fault.
Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded
At an unusual hour?


Provost

It was commanded so.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Had you a special warrant for the deed?


Provost

No, my good lord; it was by private message.


DUKE VINCENTIO

For which I do discharge you of your office:
Give up your keys.


Provost

                  Pardon me, noble lord:
I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;
Yet did repent me, after more advice;
For testimony whereof, one in the prison,
That should by private order else have died,
I have reserved alive.


DUKE VINCENTIO

What's he?


Provost

His name is Barnardine.


DUKE VINCENTIO

I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.
Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.
Exit Provost


ESCALUS

I am sorry, one so learned and so wise
As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,
Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood.
And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.


ANGELO

I am sorry that such sorrow I procure:
And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
That I crave death more willingly than mercy;
'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.
Re-enter Provost, with BARNARDINE, CLAUDIO muffled, and JULIET


DUKE VINCENTIO

Which is that Barnardine?


Provost

This, my lord.


DUKE VINCENTIO

There was a friar told me of this man.
Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul.
That apprehends no further than this world,
And squarest thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd:
But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all;
And pray thee take this mercy to provide
For better times to come. Friar, advise him;
I leave him to your hand. What muffled fellow's that?


Provost

This is another prisoner that I saved.
Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;
As like almost to Claudio as himself.
Unmuffles CLAUDIO


DUKE VINCENTIO

[To ISABELLA]  If he be like your brother, for his sake
Is he pardon'd; and, for your lovely sake,
Give me your hand and say you will be mine.
He is my brother too: but fitter time for that.
By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe;
Methinks I see a quickening in his eye.
Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well:
Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.
I find an apt remission in myself;
And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon.
To LUCIO
You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward,
One all of luxury, an ass, a madman;
Wherein have I so deserved of you,
That you extol me thus?


LUCIO

'Faith, my lord. I spoke it but according to the
trick. If you will hang me for it, you may; but I
had rather it would please you I might be whipt.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Whipt first, sir, and hanged after.
Proclaim it, provost, round about the city.
Is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow,
As I have heard him swear himself there's one
Whom he begot with child, let her appear,
And he shall marry her: the nuptial finish'd,
Let him be whipt and hang'd.


LUCIO

I beseech your highness, do not marry me to a whore.
Your highness said even now, I made you a duke:
good my lord, do not recompense me in making me a cuckold.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.
Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal
Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;
And see our pleasure herein executed.


LUCIO

Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death,
whipping, and hanging.


DUKE VINCENTIO

Slandering a prince deserves it.
Exit Officers with LUCIO
She, Claudio, that you wrong'd, look you restore.
Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo:
I have confess'd her and I know her virtue.
Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness:
There's more behind that is more gratulate.
Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy:
We shill employ thee in a worthier place.
Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home
The head of Ragozine for Claudio's:
The offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel,
I have a motion much imports your good;
Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline,
What's mine is yours and what is yours is mine.
So, bring us to our palace; where we'll show
What's yet behind, that's meet you all should know.
Exeunt




The Merchant of Venice

ACT I
SCENE I. Venice. A street.

Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO


ANTONIO

In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:
It wearies me; you say it wearies you;
But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,
I am to learn;
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,
That I have much ado to know myself.


SALARINO

Your mind is tossing on the ocean;
There, where your argosies with portly sail,
Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,
Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,
Do overpeer the petty traffickers,
That curtsy to them, do them reverence,
As they fly by them with their woven wings.


SALANIO

Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
The better part of my affections would
Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,
Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;
And every object that might make me fear
Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt
Would make me sad.


SALARINO

                  My wind cooling my broth
Would blow me to an ague, when I thought
What harm a wind too great at sea might do.
I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,
But I should think of shallows and of flats,
And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,
Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs
To kiss her burial. Should I go to church
And see the holy edifice of stone,
And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,
Would scatter all her spices on the stream,
Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,
And, in a word, but even now worth this,
And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought
To think on this, and shall I lack the thought
That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?
But tell not me; I know, Antonio
Is sad to think upon his merchandise.


ANTONIO

Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,
My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,
Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
Upon the fortune of this present year:
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.


SALARINO

Why, then you are in love.


ANTONIO

Fie, fie!


SALARINO

Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,
Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy
For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,
Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,
Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:
Some that will evermore peep through their eyes
And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,
And other of such vinegar aspect
That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,
Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.
Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO


SALANIO

Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,
Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:
We leave you now with better company.


SALARINO

I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,
If worthier friends had not prevented me.


ANTONIO

Your worth is very dear in my regard.
I take it, your own business calls on you
And you embrace the occasion to depart.


SALARINO

Good morrow, my good lords.


BASSANIO

Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?
You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?


SALARINO

We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.
Exeunt Salarino and Salanio


LORENZO

My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,
We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,
I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.


BASSANIO

I will not fail you.


GRATIANO

You look not well, Signior Antonio;
You have too much respect upon the world:
They lose it that do buy it with much care:
Believe me, you are marvellously changed.


ANTONIO

I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;
A stage where every man must play a part,
And mine a sad one.


GRATIANO

Let me play the fool:
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,
And let my liver rather heat with wine
Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.
Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,
Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?
Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio--
I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--
There are a sort of men whose visages
Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,
And do a wilful stillness entertain,
With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion
Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,
As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,
And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'
O my Antonio, I do know of these
That therefore only are reputed wise
For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,
If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,
Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.
I'll tell thee more of this another time:
But fish not, with this melancholy bait,
For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.
Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:
I'll end my exhortation after dinner.


LORENZO

Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:
I must be one of these same dumb wise men,
For Gratiano never lets me speak.


GRATIANO

Well, keep me company but two years moe,
Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.


ANTONIO

Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.


GRATIANO

Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable
In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.
Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO


ANTONIO

Is that any thing now?


BASSANIO

Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more
than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two
grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you
shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you
have them, they are not worth the search.


ANTONIO

Well, tell me now what lady is the same
To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,
That you to-day promised to tell me of?


BASSANIO

'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
How much I have disabled mine estate,
By something showing a more swelling port
Than my faint means would grant continuance:
Nor do I now make moan to be abridged
From such a noble rate; but my chief care
Is to come fairly off from the great debts
Wherein my time something too prodigal
Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,
I owe the most, in money and in love,
And from your love I have a warranty
To unburden all my plots and purposes
How to get clear of all the debts I owe.


ANTONIO

I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;
And if it stand, as you yourself still do,
Within the eye of honour, be assured,
My purse, my person, my extremest means,
Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.


BASSANIO

In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
The self-same way with more advised watch,
To find the other forth, and by adventuring both
I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,
Because what follows is pure innocence.
I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,
That which I owe is lost; but if you please
To shoot another arrow that self way
Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
As I will watch the aim, or to find both
Or bring your latter hazard back again
And thankfully rest debtor for the first.


ANTONIO

You know me well, and herein spend but time
To wind about my love with circumstance;
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
In making question of my uttermost
Than if you had made waste of all I have:
Then do but say to me what I should do
That in your knowledge may by me be done,
And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.


BASSANIO

In Belmont is a lady richly left;
And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,
Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes
I did receive fair speechless messages:
Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued
To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:
Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,
For the four winds blow in from every coast
Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks
Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;
Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,
And many Jasons come in quest of her.
O my Antonio, had I but the means
To hold a rival place with one of them,
I have a mind presages me such thrift,
That I should questionless be fortunate!


ANTONIO

Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;
Neither have I money nor commodity
To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;
Try what my credit can in Venice do:
That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,
To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.
Go, presently inquire, and so will I,
Where money is, and I no question make
To have it of my trust or for my sake.
Exeunt
SCENE II: Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.
Enter PORTIA and NERISSA


PORTIA

By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of
this great world.


NERISSA

You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in
the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and
yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit
with too much as they that starve with nothing. It
is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the
mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but
competency lives longer.


PORTIA

Good sentences and well pronounced.


NERISSA

They would be better, if well followed.


PORTIA

If to do were as easy as to know what were good to
do, chapels had been churches and poor men's
cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that
follows his own instructions: I can easier teach
twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the
twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may
devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps
o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the
youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the
cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to
choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may
neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I
dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed
by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,
Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?


NERISSA

Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their
death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,
that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,
silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning
chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any
rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what
warmth is there in your affection towards any of
these princely suitors that are already come?


PORTIA

I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest
them, I will describe them; and, according to my
description, level at my affection.


NERISSA

First, there is the Neapolitan prince.


PORTIA

Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but
talk of his horse; and he makes it a great
appropriation to his own good parts, that he can
shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his
mother played false with a smith.


NERISSA

Then there is the County Palatine.


PORTIA

He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If you
will not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales and
smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping
philosopher when he grows old, being so full of
unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be
married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth
than to either of these. God defend me from these
two!


NERISSA

How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?


PORTIA

God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.
In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,
he! why, he hath a horse better than the
Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than
the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a
throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will
fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I
should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me
I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I
shall never requite him.


NERISSA

What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron
of England?


PORTIA

You know I say nothing to him, for he understands
not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,
nor Italian, and you will come into the court and
swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.
He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can
converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!
I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round
hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his
behavior every where.


NERISSA

What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?


PORTIA

That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he
borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and
swore he would pay him again when he was able: I
think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed
under for another.


NERISSA

How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?


PORTIA

Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and
most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when
he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and
when he is worst, he is little better than a beast:
and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall
make shift to go without him.


NERISSA

If he should offer to choose, and choose the right
casket, you should refuse to perform your father's
will, if you should refuse to accept him.


PORTIA

Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a
deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,
for if the devil be within and that temptation
without, I know he will choose it. I will do any
thing, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge.


NERISSA

You need not fear, lady, the having any of these
lords: they have acquainted me with their
determinations; which is, indeed, to return to their
home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless
you may be won by some other sort than your father's
imposition depending on the caskets.


PORTIA

If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as
chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner
of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers
are so reasonable, for there is not one among them
but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant
them a fair departure.


NERISSA

Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a
Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither
in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?


PORTIA

Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, he was so called.


NERISSA

True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish
eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.


PORTIA

I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of
thy praise.
Enter a Serving-man
How now! what news?


Servant

The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take
their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a
fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the
prince his master will be here to-night.


PORTIA

If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a
heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should
be glad of his approach: if he have the condition
of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had
rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,
Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.
Whiles we shut the gates
upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.
Exeunt

SCENE III. Venice. A public place.

Enter BASSANIO and SHYLOCK


SHYLOCK

Three thousand ducats; well.


BASSANIO

Ay, sir, for three months.


SHYLOCK

For three months; well.


BASSANIO

For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.


SHYLOCK

Antonio shall become bound; well.


BASSANIO

May you stead me? will you pleasure me? shall I
know your answer?


SHYLOCK

Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound.


BASSANIO

Your answer to that.


SHYLOCK

Antonio is a good man.


BASSANIO

Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?


SHYLOCK

Oh, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a
good man is to have you understand me that he is
sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he
hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the
Indies; I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he
hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and
other ventures he hath, squandered abroad. But ships
are but boards, sailors but men: there be land-rats
and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I
mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters,
winds and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding,
sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I may
take his bond.


BASSANIO

Be assured you may.


SHYLOCK

I will be assured I may; and, that I may be assured,
I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?


BASSANIO

If it please you to dine with us.


SHYLOCK

Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation which
your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. I
will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,
walk with you, and so following, but I will not eat
with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What
news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?
Enter ANTONIO


BASSANIO

This is Signior Antonio.


SHYLOCK

[Aside]  How like a fawning publican he looks!
I hate him for he is a Christian,
But more for that in low simplicity
He lends out money gratis and brings down
The rate of usance here with us in Venice.
If I can catch him once upon the hip,
I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.
He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,
Even there where merchants most do congregate,
On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe,
If I forgive him!


BASSANIO

                  Shylock, do you hear?


SHYLOCK

I am debating of my present store,
And, by the near guess of my memory,
I cannot instantly raise up the gross
Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?
Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,
Will furnish me. But soft! how many months
Do you desire?
To ANTONIO
Rest you fair, good signior;
Your worship was the last man in our mouths.


ANTONIO

Shylock, although I neither lend nor borrow
By taking nor by giving of excess,
Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'd
How much ye would?


SHYLOCK

                  Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.


ANTONIO

And for three months.


SHYLOCK

I had forgot; three months; you told me so.
Well then, your bond; and let me see; but hear you;
Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow
Upon advantage.


ANTONIO

                  I do never use it.


SHYLOCK

When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep--
This Jacob from our holy Abram was,
As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,
The third possessor; ay, he was the third--


ANTONIO

And what of him? did he take interest?


SHYLOCK

No, not take interest, not, as you would say,
Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.
When Laban and himself were compromised
That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied
Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank,
In the end of autumn turned to the rams,
And, when the work of generation was
Between these woolly breeders in the act,
The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,
And, in the doing of the deed of kind,
He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,
Who then conceiving did in eaning time
Fall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's.
This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:
And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.


ANTONIO

This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for;
A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.
Was this inserted to make interest good?
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?


SHYLOCK

I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:
But note me, signior.


ANTONIO

Mark you this, Bassanio,
The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
An evil soul producing holy witness
Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,
A goodly apple rotten at the heart:
O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!


SHYLOCK

Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.
Three months from twelve; then, let me see; the rate--


ANTONIO

Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?


SHYLOCK

Signior Antonio, many a time and oft
In the Rialto you have rated me
About my moneys and my usances:
Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,
For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.
You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,
And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,
And all for use of that which is mine own.
Well then, it now appears you need my help:
Go to, then; you come to me, and you say
'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so;
You, that did void your rheum upon my beard
And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
Over your threshold: moneys is your suit
What should I say to you? Should I not say
'Hath a dog money? is it possible
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or
Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key,
With bated breath and whispering humbleness, Say this;
'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;
You spurn'd me such a day; another time
You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies
I'll lend you thus much moneys'?


ANTONIO

I am as like to call thee so again,
To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.
If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not
As to thy friends; for when did friendship take
A breed for barren metal of his friend?
But lend it rather to thine enemy,
Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face
Exact the penalty.


SHYLOCK

                  Why, look you, how you storm!
I would be friends with you and have your love,
Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with,
Supply your present wants and take no doit
Of usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear me:
This is kind I offer.


BASSANIO

This were kindness.


SHYLOCK

This kindness will I show.
Go with me to a notary, seal me there
Your single bond; and, in a merry sport,
If you repay me not on such a day,
In such a place, such sum or sums as are
Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit
Be nominated for an equal pound
Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken
In what part of your body pleaseth me.


ANTONIO

Content, i' faith: I'll seal to such a bond
And say there is much kindness in the Jew.


BASSANIO

You shall not seal to such a bond for me:
I'll rather dwell in my necessity.


ANTONIO

Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it:
Within these two months, that's a month before
This bond expires, I do expect return
Of thrice three times the value of this bond.


SHYLOCK

O father Abram, what these Christians are,
Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect
The thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this;
If he should break his day, what should I gain
By the exaction of the forfeiture?
A pound of man's flesh taken from a man
Is not so estimable, profitable neither,
As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,
To buy his favour, I extend this friendship:
If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;
And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.


ANTONIO

Yes Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.


SHYLOCK

Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;
Give him direction for this merry bond,
And I will go and purse the ducats straight,
See to my house, left in the fearful guard
Of an unthrifty knave, and presently
I will be with you.


ANTONIO

Hie thee, gentle Jew.
Exit Shylock
The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.


BASSANIO

I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.


ANTONIO

Come on: in this there can be no dismay;
My ships come home a month before the day.
Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.

Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF MOROCCO  and his train; PORTIA, NERISSA, and others attending


MOROCCO

Mislike me not for my complexion,
The shadow'd livery of the burnish'd sun,
To whom I am a neighbour and near bred.
Bring me the fairest creature northward born,
Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles,
And let us make incision for your love,
To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.
I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine
Hath fear'd the valiant: by my love I swear
The best-regarded virgins of our clime
Have loved it too: I would not change this hue,
Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.


PORTIA

In terms of choice I am not solely led
By nice direction of a maiden's eyes;
Besides, the lottery of my destiny
Bars me the right of voluntary choosing:
But if my father had not scanted me
And hedged me by his wit, to yield myself
His wife who wins me by that means I told you,
Yourself, renowned prince, then stood as fair
As any comer I have look'd on yet
For my affection.


MOROCCO

                  Even for that I thank you:
Therefore, I pray you, lead me to the caskets
To try my fortune. By this scimitar
That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince
That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,
I would outstare the sternest eyes that look,
Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,
Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,
Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,
To win thee, lady. But, alas the while!
If Hercules and Lichas play at dice
Which is the better man, the greater throw
May turn by fortune from the weaker hand:
So is Alcides beaten by his page;
And so may I, blind fortune leading me,
Miss that which one unworthier may attain,
And die with grieving.


PORTIA

You must take your chance,
And either not attempt to choose at all
Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong
Never to speak to lady afterward
In way of marriage: therefore be advised.


MOROCCO

Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.


PORTIA

First, forward to the temple: after dinner
Your hazard shall be made.


MOROCCO

Good fortune then!
To make me blest or cursed'st among men.
Cornets, and exeunt

SCENE II. Venice. A street.

Enter LAUNCELOT


LAUNCELOT

Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from
this Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and
tempts me saying to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good
Launcelot,' or 'good Gobbo,' or good Launcelot
Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away. My
conscience says 'No; take heed,' honest Launcelot;
take heed, honest Gobbo, or, as aforesaid, 'honest
Launcelot Gobbo; do not run; scorn running with thy
heels.' Well, the most courageous fiend bids me
pack: 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the
fiend; 'for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,'
says the fiend, 'and run.' Well, my conscience,
hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely
to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest
man's son,' or rather an honest woman's son; for,
indeed, my father did something smack, something
grow to, he had a kind of taste; well, my conscience
says 'Launcelot, budge not.' 'Budge,' says the
fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience.
'Conscience,' say I, 'you counsel well;' ' Fiend,'
say I, 'you counsel well:' to be ruled by my
conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master,
who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil; and, to
run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the
fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil
himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil
incarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience is
but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel
me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more
friendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels are
at your command; I will run.
Enter Old GOBBO, with a basket


GOBBO

Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way
to master Jew's?


LAUNCELOT

[Aside]  O heavens, this is my true-begotten father!
who, being more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind,
knows me not: I will try confusions with him.


GOBBO

Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way
to master Jew's?


LAUNCELOT

Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but,
at the next turning of all, on your left; marry, at
the very next turning, turn of no hand, but turn
down indirectly to the Jew's house.


GOBBO

By God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit. Can
you tell me whether one Launcelot,
that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?


LAUNCELOT

Talk you of young Master Launcelot?
Aside
Mark me now; now will I raise the waters. Talk you
of young Master Launcelot?


GOBBO

No master, sir, but a poor man's son: his father,
though I say it, is an honest exceeding poor man
and, God be thanked, well to live.


LAUNCELOT

Well, let his father be what a' will, we talk of
young Master Launcelot.


GOBBO

Your worship's friend and Launcelot, sir.


LAUNCELOT

But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you,
talk you of young Master Launcelot?


GOBBO

Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.


LAUNCELOT

Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master
Launcelot, father; for the young gentleman,
according to Fates and Destinies and such odd
sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of
learning, is indeed deceased, or, as you would say
in plain terms, gone to heaven.


GOBBO

Marry, God forbid! the boy was the very staff of my
age, my very prop.


LAUNCELOT

Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or
a prop? Do you know me, father?


GOBBO

Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman:
but, I pray you, tell me, is my boy, God rest his
soul, alive or dead?


LAUNCELOT

Do you not know me, father?


GOBBO

Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.


LAUNCELOT

Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of
the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his
own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of
your son: give me your blessing: truth will come
to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man's son
may, but at the length truth will out.


GOBBO

Pray you, sir, stand up: I am sure you are not
Launcelot, my boy.


LAUNCELOT

Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but
give me your blessing: I am Launcelot, your boy
that was, your son that is, your child that shall
be.


GOBBO

I cannot think you are my son.


LAUNCELOT

I know not what I shall think of that: but I am
Launcelot, the Jew's man, and I am sure Margery your
wife is my mother.


GOBBO

Her name is Margery, indeed: I'll be sworn, if thou
be Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood.
Lord worshipped might he be! what a beard hast thou
got! thou hast got more hair on thy chin than
Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.


LAUNCELOT

It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows
backward: I am sure he had more hair of his tail
than I have of my face when I last saw him.


GOBBO

Lord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy
master agree? I have brought him a present. How
'gree you now?


LAUNCELOT

Well, well: but, for mine own part, as I have set
up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I
have run some ground. My master's a very Jew: give
him a present! give him a halter: I am famished in
his service; you may tell every finger I have with
my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come: give me
your present to one Master Bassanio, who, indeed,
gives rare new liveries: if I serve not him, I
will run as far as God has any ground. O rare
fortune! here comes the man: to him, father; for I
am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer.
Enter BASSANIO, with LEONARDO and other followers


BASSANIO

You may do so; but let it be so hasted that supper
be ready at the farthest by five of the clock. See
these letters delivered; put the liveries to making,
and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.
Exit a Servant


LAUNCELOT

To him, father.


GOBBO

God bless your worship!


BASSANIO

Gramercy! wouldst thou aught with me?


GOBBO

Here's my son, sir, a poor boy,--


LAUNCELOT

Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man; that
would, sir, as my father shall specify--


GOBBO

He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve--


LAUNCELOT

Indeed, the short and the long is, I serve the Jew,
and have a desire, as my father shall specify--


GOBBO

His master and he, saving your worship's reverence,
are scarce cater-cousins--


LAUNCELOT

To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having
done me wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being, I
hope, an old man, shall frutify unto you--


GOBBO

I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon
your worship, and my suit is--


LAUNCELOT

In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as
your worship shall know by this honest old man; and,
though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my father.


BASSANIO

One speak for both. What would you?


LAUNCELOT

Serve you, sir.


GOBBO

That is the very defect of the matter, sir.


BASSANIO

I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit:
Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,
And hath preferr'd thee, if it be preferment
To leave a rich Jew's service, to become
The follower of so poor a gentleman.


LAUNCELOT

The old proverb is very well parted between my
master Shylock and you, sir: you have the grace of
God, sir, and he hath enough.


BASSANIO

Thou speak'st it well. Go, father, with thy son.
Take leave of thy old master and inquire
My lodging out. Give him a livery
More guarded than his fellows': see it done.


LAUNCELOT

Father, in. I cannot get a service, no; I have
ne'er a tongue in my head. Well, if any man in
Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear
upon a book, I shall have good fortune. Go to,
here's a simple line of life: here's a small trifle
of wives: alas, fifteen wives is nothing! eleven
widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one
man: and then to 'scape drowning thrice, and to be
in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed;
here are simple scapes. Well, if Fortune be a
woman, she's a good wench for this gear. Father,
come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye.
Exeunt Launcelot and Old Gobbo


BASSANIO

I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this:
These things being bought and orderly bestow'd,
Return in haste, for I do feast to-night
My best-esteem'd acquaintance: hie thee, go.


LEONARDO

My best endeavours shall be done herein.
Enter GRATIANO


GRATIANO

Where is your master?


LEONARDO

Yonder, sir, he walks.
Exit


GRATIANO

Signior Bassanio!


BASSANIO

Gratiano!


GRATIANO

I have a suit to you.


BASSANIO

You have obtain'd it.


GRATIANO

You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.


BASSANIO

Why then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano;
Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice;
Parts that become thee happily enough
And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;
But where thou art not known, why, there they show
Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain
To allay with some cold drops of modesty
Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behavior
I be misconstrued in the place I go to,
And lose my hopes.


GRATIANO

                  Signior Bassanio, hear me:
If I do not put on a sober habit,
Talk with respect and swear but now and then,
Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely,
Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes
Thus with my hat, and sigh and say 'amen,'
Use all the observance of civility,
Like one well studied in a sad ostent
To please his grandam, never trust me more.


BASSANIO

Well, we shall see your bearing.


GRATIANO

Nay, but I bar to-night: you shall not gauge me
By what we do to-night.


BASSANIO

No, that were pity:
I would entreat you rather to put on
Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends
That purpose merriment. But fare you well:
I have some business.


GRATIANO

And I must to Lorenzo and the rest:
But we will visit you at supper-time.
Exeunt

SCENE III. The same. A room in SHYLOCK'S house.

Enter JESSICA and LAUNCELOT


JESSICA

I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so:
Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil,
Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.
But fare thee well, there is a ducat for thee:
And, Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see
Lorenzo, who is thy new master's guest:
Give him this letter; do it secretly;
And so farewell: I would not have my father
See me in talk with thee.


LAUNCELOT

Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautiful
pagan, most sweet Jew! if a Christian did not play
the knave and get thee, I am much deceived. But,
adieu: these foolish drops do something drown my
manly spirit: adieu.


JESSICA

Farewell, good Launcelot.
Exit Launcelot
Alack, what heinous sin is it in me
To be ashamed to be my father's child!
But though I am a daughter to his blood,
I am not to his manners. O Lorenzo,
If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife,
Become a Christian and thy loving wife.
Exit

SCENE IV. The same. A street.

Enter GRATIANO, LORENZO, SALARINO, and SALANIO


LORENZO

Nay, we will slink away in supper-time,
Disguise us at my lodging and return,
All in an hour.


GRATIANO

We have not made good preparation.


SALARINO

We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.


SALANIO

'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly order'd,
And better in my mind not undertook.


LORENZO

'Tis now but four o'clock: we have two hours
To furnish us.
Enter LAUNCELOT, with a letter
Friend Launcelot, what's the news?


LAUNCELOT

An it shall please you to break up
this, it shall seem to signify.


LORENZO

I know the hand: in faith, 'tis a fair hand;
And whiter than the paper it writ on
Is the fair hand that writ.


GRATIANO

Love-news, in faith.


LAUNCELOT

By your leave, sir.


LORENZO

Whither goest thou?


LAUNCELOT

Marry, sir, to bid my old master the
Jew to sup to-night with my new master the Christian.


LORENZO

Hold here, take this: tell gentle Jessica
I will not fail her; speak it privately.
Go, gentlemen,
Exit Launcelot
Will you prepare you for this masque tonight?
I am provided of a torch-bearer.


SALANIO

Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight.


SALANIO

And so will I.


LORENZO

                  Meet me and Gratiano
At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence.


SALARINO

'Tis good we do so.
Exeunt SALARINO and SALANIO


GRATIANO

Was not that letter from fair Jessica?


LORENZO

I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed
How I shall take her from her father's house,
What gold and jewels she is furnish'd with,
What page's suit she hath in readiness.
If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven,
It will be for his gentle daughter's sake:
And never dare misfortune cross her foot,
Unless she do it under this excuse,
That she is issue to a faithless Jew.
Come, go with me; peruse this as thou goest:
Fair Jessica shall be my torch-beare r.
Exeunt

SCENE V. The same. Before SHYLOCK'S house.

Enter SHYLOCK and LAUNCELOT


SHYLOCK

Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge,
The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio:--
What, Jessica!--thou shalt not gormandise,
As thou hast done with me:--What, Jessica!--
And sleep and snore, and rend apparel out;--
Why, Jessica, I say!


LAUNCELOT

Why, Jessica!


SHYLOCK

Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.


LAUNCELOT

Your worship was wont to tell me that
I could do nothing without bidding.
Enter Jessica


JESSICA

Call you? what is your will?


SHYLOCK

I am bid forth to supper, Jessica:
There are my keys. But wherefore should I go?
I am not bid for love; they flatter me:
But yet I'll go in hate, to feed upon
The prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl,
Look to my house. I am right loath to go:
There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,
For I did dream of money-bags to-night.


LAUNCELOT

I beseech you, sir, go: my young master doth expect
your reproach.


SHYLOCK

So do I his.


LAUNCELOT

An they have conspired together, I will not say you
shall see a masque; but if you do, then it was not
for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on
Black-Monday last at six o'clock i' the morning,
falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four
year, in the afternoon.


SHYLOCK

What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica:
Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum
And the vile squealing of the wry-neck'd fife,
Clamber not you up to the casements then,
Nor thrust your head into the public street
To gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd faces,
But stop my house's ears, I mean my casements:
Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter
My sober house. By Jacob's staff, I swear,
I have no mind of feasting forth to-night:
But I will go. Go you before me, sirrah;
Say I will come.


LAUNCELOT

I will go before, sir. Mistress, look out at
window, for all this, There will come a Christian
boy, will be worth a Jewess' eye.
Exit


SHYLOCK

What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?


JESSICA

His words were 'Farewell mistress;' nothing else.


SHYLOCK

The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder;
Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day
More than the wild-cat: drones hive not with me;
Therefore I part with him, and part with him
To one that would have him help to waste
His borrow'd purse. Well, Jessica, go in;
Perhaps I will return immediately:
Do as I bid you; shut doors after you:
Fast bind, fast find;
A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.
Exit


JESSICA

Farewell; and if my fortune be not crost,
I have a father, you a daughter, lost.
Exit

SCENE VI. The same.

Enter GRATIANO and SALARINO, masqued


GRATIANO

This is the pent-house under which Lorenzo
Desired us to make stand.


SALARINO

His hour is almost past.


GRATIANO

And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,
For lovers ever run before the clock.


SALARINO

O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly
To seal love's bonds new-made, than they are wont
To keep obliged faith unforfeited!


GRATIANO

That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
With that keen appetite that he sits down?
Where is the horse that doth untread again
His tedious measures with the unbated fire
That he did pace them first? All things that are,
Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd.
How like a younker or a prodigal
The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,
Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind!
How like the prodigal doth she return,
With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails,
Lean, rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!


SALARINO

Here comes Lorenzo: more of this hereafter.
Enter LORENZO


LORENZO

Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;
Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait:
When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,
I'll watch as long for you then. Approach;
Here dwells my father Jew. Ho! who's within?
Enter JESSICA, above, in boy's clothes


JESSICA

Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty,
Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.


LORENZO

Lorenzo, and thy love.


JESSICA

Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed,
For who love I so much? And now who knows
But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?


LORENZO

Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.


JESSICA

Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me,
For I am much ashamed of my exchange:
But love is blind and lovers cannot see
The pretty follies that themselves commit;
For if they could, Cupid himself would blush
To see me thus transformed to a boy.


LORENZO

Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.


JESSICA

What, must I hold a candle to my shames?
They in themselves, good-sooth, are too too light.
Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love;
And I should be obscured.


LORENZO

So are you, sweet,
Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.
But come at once;
For the close night doth play the runaway,
And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast.


JESSICA

I will make fast the doors, and gild myself
With some more ducats, and be with you straight.
Exit above


GRATIANO

Now, by my hood, a Gentile and no Jew.


LORENZO

Beshrew me but I love her heartily;
For she is wise, if I can judge of her,
And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,
And true she is, as she hath proved herself,
And therefore, like herself, wise, fair and true,
Shall she be placed in my constant soul.
Enter JESSICA, below
What, art thou come? On, gentlemen; away!
Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.
Exit with Jessica and Salarino
Enter ANTONIO


ANTONIO

Who's there?


GRATIANO

Signior Antonio!


ANTONIO

Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest?
'Tis nine o'clock: our friends all stay for you.
No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
Bassanio presently will go aboard:
I have sent twenty out to seek for you.


GRATIANO

I am glad on't: I desire no more delight
Than to be under sail and gone to-night.
Exeunt

SCENE VII. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.

Flourish of cornets. Enter PORTIA, with the PRINCE OF MOROCCO, and their trains


PORTIA

Go draw aside the curtains and discover
The several caskets to this noble prince.
Now make your choice.


MOROCCO

The first, of gold, who this inscription bears,
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire;'
The second, silver, which this promise carries,
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves;'
This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
How shall I know if I do choose the right?


PORTIA

The one of them contains my picture, prince:
If you choose that, then I am yours withal.


MOROCCO

Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;
I will survey the inscriptions back again.
What says this leaden casket?
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?
This casket threatens. Men that hazard all
Do it in hope of fair advantages:
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.
What says the silver with her virgin hue?
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,
And weigh thy value with an even hand:
If thou be'st rated by thy estimation,
Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough
May not extend so far as to the lady:
And yet to be afeard of my deserving
Were but a weak disabling of myself.
As much as I deserve! Why, that's the lady:
I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,
In graces and in qualities of breeding;
But more than these, in love I do deserve.
What if I stray'd no further, but chose here?
Let's see once more this saying graved in gold
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
Why, that's the lady; all the world desires her;
From the four corners of the earth they come,
To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint:
The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now
For princes to come view fair Portia:
The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head
Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar
To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,
As o'er a brook, to see fair Portia.
One of these three contains her heavenly picture.
Is't like that lead contains her? 'Twere damnation
To think so base a thought: it were too gross
To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.
Or shall I think in silver she's immured,
Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?
O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem
Was set in worse than gold. They have in England
A coin that bears the figure of an angel
Stamped in gold, but that's insculp'd upon;
But here an angel in a golden bed
Lies all within. Deliver me the key:
Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!


PORTIA

There, take it, prince; and if my form lie there,
Then I am yours.
He unlocks the golden casket


MOROCCO

                  O hell! what have we here?
A carrion Death, within whose empty eye
There is a written scroll! I'll read the writing.
Reads
All that glitters is not gold;
Often have you heard that told:
Many a man his life hath sold
But my outside to behold:
Gilded tombs do worms enfold.
Had you been as wise as bold,
Young in limbs, in judgment old,
Your answer had not been inscroll'd:
Fare you well; your suit is cold.
Cold, indeed; and labour lost:
Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost!
Portia, adieu. I have too grieved a heart
To take a tedious leave: thus losers part.
Exit with his train. Flourish of cornets


PORTIA

A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains, go.
Let all of his complexion choose me so.
Exeunt

SCENE VIII. Venice. A street.

Enter SALARINO and SALANIO


SALARINO

Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail:
With him is Gratiano gone along;
And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.


SALANIO

The villain Jew with outcries raised the duke,
Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.


SALARINO

He came too late, the ship was under sail:
But there the duke was given to understand
That in a gondola were seen together
Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica:
Besides, Antonio certified the duke
They were not with Bassanio in his ship.


SALANIO

I never heard a passion so confused,
So strange, outrageous, and so variable,
As the dog Jew did utter in the streets:
'My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!
Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!
Justice! the law! my ducats, and my daughter!
A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
Of double ducats, stolen from me by my daughter!
And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,
Stolen by my daughter! Justice! find the girl;
She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.'


SALARINO

Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,
Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.


SALANIO

Let good Antonio look he keep his day,
Or he shall pay for this.


SALARINO

Marry, well remember'd.
I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,
Who told me, in the narrow seas that part
The French and English, there miscarried
A vessel of our country richly fraught:
I thought upon Antonio when he told me;
And wish'd in silence that it were not his.


SALANIO

You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;
Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.


SALARINO

A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:
Bassanio told him he would make some speed
Of his return: he answer'd, 'Do not so;
Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio
But stay the very riping of the time;
And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,
Let it not enter in your mind of love:
Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts
To courtship and such fair ostents of love
As shall conveniently become you there:'
And even there, his eye being big with tears,
Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,
And with affection wondrous sensible
He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.


SALANIO

I think he only loves the world for him.
I pray thee, let us go and find him out
And quicken his embraced heaviness
With some delight or other.


SALARINO

Do we so.
Exeunt

SCENE IX. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.

Enter NERISSA with a Servitor


NERISSA

Quick, quick, I pray thee; draw the curtain straight:
The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath,
And comes to his election presently.
Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF ARRAGON, PORTIA, and their trains


PORTIA

Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince:
If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,
Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized:
But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,
You must be gone from hence immediately.


ARRAGON

I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:
First, never to unfold to any one
Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail
Of the right casket, never in my life
To woo a maid in way of marriage: Lastly,
If I do fail in fortune of my choice,
Immediately to leave you and be gone.


PORTIA

To these injunctions every one doth swear
That comes to hazard for my worthless self.


ARRAGON

And so have I address'd me. Fortune now
To my heart's hope! Gold; silver; and base lead.
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard.
What says the golden chest? ha! let me see:
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
What many men desire! that 'many' may be meant
By the fool multitude, that choose by show,
Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
Which pries not to the interior, but, like the martlet,
Builds in the weather on the outward wall,
Even in the force and road of casualty.
I will not choose what many men desire,
Because I will not jump with common spirits
And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.
Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house;
Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:'
And well said too; for who shall go about
To cozen fortune and be honourable
Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume
To wear an undeserved dignity.
O, that estates, degrees and offices
Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honour
Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!
How many then should cover that stand bare!
How many be commanded that command!
How much low peasantry would then be glean'd
From the true seed of honour! and how much honour
Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times
To be new-varnish'd! Well, but to my choice:
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,
And instantly unlock my fortunes here.
He opens the silver casket


PORTIA

Too long a pause for that which you find there.


ARRAGON

What's here? the portrait of a blinking idiot,
Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.
How much unlike art thou to Portia!
How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!
'Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.'
Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?
Is that my prize? are my deserts no better?


PORTIA

To offend, and judge, are distinct offices
And of opposed natures.


ARRAGON

What is here?
Reads
The fire seven times tried this:
Seven times tried that judgment is,
That did never choose amiss.
Some there be that shadows kiss;
Such have but a shadow's bliss:
There be fools alive, I wis,
Silver'd o'er; and so was this.
Take what wife you will to bed,
I will ever be your head:
So be gone: you are sped.
Still more fool I shall appear
By the time I linger here
With one fool's head I came to woo,
But I go away with two.
Sweet, adieu. I'll keep my oath,
Patiently to bear my wroth.
Exeunt Arragon and train


PORTIA

Thus hath the candle singed the moth.
O, these deliberate fools! when they do choose,
They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.


NERISSA

The ancient saying is no heresy,
Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.


PORTIA

Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.
Enter a Servant


Servant

Where is my lady?


PORTIA

                  Here: what would my lord?


Servant

Madam, there is alighted at your gate
A young Venetian, one that comes before
To signify the approaching of his lord;
From whom he bringeth sensible regreets,
To wit, besides commends and courteous breath,
Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen
So likely an ambassador of love:
A day in April never came so sweet,
To show how costly summer was at hand,
As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.


PORTIA

No more, I pray thee: I am half afeard
Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,
Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him.
Come, come, Nerissa; for I long to see
Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly.


NERISSA

Bassanio, lord Love, if thy will it be!
Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. Venice. A street.

Enter SALANIO and SALARINO


SALANIO

Now, what news on the Rialto?


SALARINO

Why, yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hath
a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas;
the Goodwins, I think they call the place; a very
dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many
a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip
Report be an honest woman of her word.


SALANIO

I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever
knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she
wept for the death of a third husband. But it is
true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the
plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the
honest Antonio,--O that I had a title good enough
to keep his name company!--


SALARINO

Come, the full stop.


SALANIO

Ha! what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath
lost a ship.


SALARINO

I would it might prove the end of his losses.


SALANIO

Let me say 'amen' betimes, lest the devil cross my
prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.
Enter SHYLOCK
How now, Shylock! what news among the merchants?


SHYLOCK

You know, none so well, none so well as you, of my
daughter's flight.


SALARINO

That's certain: I, for my part, knew the tailor
that made the wings she flew withal.


SALANIO

And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was
fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all
to leave the dam.


SHYLOCK

She is damned for it.


SALANIO

That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.


SHYLOCK

My own flesh and blood to rebel!


SALANIO

Out upon it, old carrion! rebels it at these years?


SHYLOCK

I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood.


SALARINO

There is more difference between thy flesh and hers
than between jet and ivory; more between your bloods
than there is between red wine and rhenish. But
tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any
loss at sea or no?


SHYLOCK

There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a
prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the
Rialto; a beggar, that was used to come so smug upon
the mart; let him look to his bond: he was wont to
call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was
wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him
look to his bond.


SALARINO

Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take
his flesh: what's that good for?


SHYLOCK

To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else,
it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and
hindered me half a million; laughed at my losses,
mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my
bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine
enemies; and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath
not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs,
dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with
the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject
to the same diseases, healed by the same means,
warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as
a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed?
if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison
us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not
revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will
resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,
what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian
wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by
Christian example? Why, revenge. The villany you
teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I
will better the instruction.
Enter a Servant


Servant

Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house and
desires to speak with you both.


SALARINO

We have been up and down to seek him.
Enter TUBAL


SALANIO

Here comes another of the tribe: a third cannot be
matched, unless the devil himself turn Jew.
Exeunt SALANIO, SALARINO, and Servant


SHYLOCK

How now, Tubal! what news from Genoa? hast thou
found my daughter?


TUBAL

I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.


SHYLOCK

Why, there, there, there, there! a diamond gone,
cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse
never fell upon our nation till now; I never felt it
till now: two thousand ducats in that; and other
precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter
were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear!
would she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in
her coffin! No news of them? Why, so: and I know
not what's spent in the search: why, thou loss upon
loss! the thief gone with so much, and so much to
find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge:
nor no in luck stirring but what lights on my
shoulders; no sighs but of my breathing; no tears
but of my shedding.


TUBAL

Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as I
heard in Genoa,--


SHYLOCK

What, what, what? ill luck, ill luck?


TUBAL

Hath an argosy cast away, coming from Tripolis.


SHYLOCK

I thank God, I thank God. Is't true, is't true?


TUBAL

I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.


SHYLOCK

I thank thee, good Tubal: good news, good news!
ha, ha! where? in Genoa?


TUBAL

Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, in one
night fourscore ducats.


SHYLOCK

Thou stickest a dagger in me: I shall never see my
gold again: fourscore ducats at a sitting!
fourscore ducats!


TUBAL

There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my
company to Venice, that swear he cannot choose but break.


SHYLOCK

I am very glad of it: I'll plague him; I'll torture
him: I am glad of it.


TUBAL

One of them showed me a ring that he had of your
daughter for a monkey.


SHYLOCK

Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my
turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor:
I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.


TUBAL

But Antonio is certainly undone.


SHYLOCK

Nay, that's true, that's very true. Go, Tubal, fee
me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I
will have the heart of him, if he forfeit; for, were
he out of Venice, I can make what merchandise I
will. Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue;
go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal.
Exeunt

SCENE II. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.

Enter BASSANIO, PORTIA, GRATIANO, NERISSA, and Attendants


PORTIA

I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two
Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,
I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.
There's something tells me, but it is not love,
I would not lose you; and you know yourself,
Hate counsels not in such a quality.
But lest you should not understand me well,--
And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,--
I would detain you here some month or two
Before you venture for me. I could teach you
How to choose right, but I am then forsworn;
So will I never be: so may you miss me;
But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,
That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,
They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;
One half of me is yours, the other half yours,
Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,
And so all yours. O, these naughty times
Put bars between the owners and their rights!
And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,
Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.
I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,
To eke it and to draw it out in length,
To stay you from election.


BASSANIO

Let me choose
For as I am, I live upon the rack.


PORTIA

Upon the rack, Bassanio! then confess
What treason there is mingled with your love.


BASSANIO

None but that ugly treason of mistrust,
Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love:
There may as well be amity and life
'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.


PORTIA

Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,
Where men enforced do speak anything.


BASSANIO

Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.


PORTIA

Well then, confess and live.


BASSANIO

'Confess' and 'love'
Had been the very sum of my confession:
O happy torment, when my torturer
Doth teach me answers for deliverance!
But let me to my fortune and the caskets.


PORTIA

Away, then! I am lock'd in one of them:
If you do love me, you will find me out.
Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.
Let music sound while he doth make his choice;
Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,
Fading in music: that the comparison
May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream
And watery death-bed for him. He may win;
And what is music then? Then music is
Even as the flourish when true subjects bow
To a new-crowned monarch: such it is
As are those dulcet sounds in break of day
That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear,
And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,
With no less presence, but with much more love,
Than young Alcides, when he did redeem
The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy
To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice
The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,
With bleared visages, come forth to view
The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!
Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay
I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.
Music, whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself
SONG.
Tell me where is fancy bred,
Or in the heart, or in the head?
How begot, how nourished?
Reply, reply.
It is engender'd in the eyes,
With gazing fed; and fancy dies
In the cradle where it lies.
Let us all ring fancy's knell
I'll begin it,--Ding, dong, bell.


ALL

Ding, dong, bell.


BASSANIO

So may the outward shows be least themselves:
The world is still deceived with ornament.
In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,
But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,
Obscures the show of evil? In religion,
What damned error, but some sober brow
Will bless it and approve it with a text,
Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?
There is no vice so simple but assumes
Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:
How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false
As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins
The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;
Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk;
And these assume but valour's excrement
To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,
And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight;
Which therein works a miracle in nature,
Making them lightest that wear most of it:
So are those crisped snaky golden locks
Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,
Upon supposed fairness, often known
To be the dowry of a second head,
The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.
Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf
Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,
The seeming truth which cunning times put on
To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,
Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;
Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,
Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,
Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;
And here choose I; joy be the consequence!


PORTIA

[Aside]  How all the other passions fleet to air,
As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair,
And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy! O love,
Be moderate; allay thy ecstasy,
In measure rein thy joy; scant this excess.
I feel too much thy blessing: make it less,
For fear I surfeit.


BASSANIO

What find I here?
Opening the leaden casket
Fair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-god
Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?
Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,
Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,
Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar
Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs
The painter plays the spider and hath woven
A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,
Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,--
How could he see to do them? having made one,
Methinks it should have power to steal both his
And leave itself unfurnish'd. Yet look, how far
The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
In underprizing it, so far this shadow
Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll,
The continent and summary of my fortune.
Reads
You that choose not by the view,
Chance as fair and choose as true!
Since this fortune falls to you,
Be content and seek no new,
If you be well pleased with this
And hold your fortune for your bliss,
Turn you where your lady is
And claim her with a loving kiss.
A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;
I come by note, to give and to receive.
Like one of two contending in a prize,
That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes,
Hearing applause and universal shout,
Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt
Whether these pearls of praise be his or no;
So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so;
As doubtful whether what I see be true,
Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you.


PORTIA

You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,
Such as I am: though for myself alone
I would not be ambitious in my wish,
To wish myself much better; yet, for you
I would be trebled twenty times myself;
A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich;
That only to stand high in your account,
I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,
Exceed account; but the full sum of me
Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,
Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractised;
Happy in this, she is not yet so old
But she may learn; happier than this,
She is not bred so dull but she can learn;
Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
Commits itself to yours to be directed,
As from her lord, her governor, her king.
Myself and what is mine to you and yours
Is now converted: but now I was the lord
Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,
Queen o'er myself: and even now, but now,
This house, these servants and this same myself
Are yours, my lord: I give them with this ring;
Which when you part from, lose, or give away,
Let it presage the ruin of your love
And be my vantage to exclaim on you.


BASSANIO

Madam, you have bereft me of all words,
Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;
And there is such confusion in my powers,
As after some oration fairly spoke
By a beloved prince, there doth appear
Among the buzzing pleased multitude;
Where every something, being blent together,
Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy,
Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence:
O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead!


NERISSA

My lord and lady, it is now our time,
That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,
To cry, good joy: good joy, my lord and lady!


GRATIANO

My lord Bassanio and my gentle lady,
I wish you all the joy that you can wish;
For I am sure you can wish none from me:
And when your honours mean to solemnize
The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you,
Even at that time I may be married too.


BASSANIO

With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.


GRATIANO

I thank your lordship, you have got me one.
My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:
You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;
You loved, I loved for intermission.
No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.
Your fortune stood upon the casket there,
And so did mine too, as the matter falls;
For wooing here until I sweat again,
And sweating until my very roof was dry
With oaths of love, at last, if promise last,
I got a promise of this fair one here
To have her love, provided that your fortune
Achieved her mistress.


PORTIA

Is this true, Nerissa?


NERISSA

Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal.


BASSANIO

And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?


GRATIANO

Yes, faith, my lord.


BASSANIO

Our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage.


GRATIANO

We'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.


NERISSA

What, and stake down?


GRATIANO

No; we shall ne'er win at that sport, and stake down.
But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? What,
and my old Venetian friend Salerio?
Enter LORENZO, JESSICA, and SALERIO, a Messenger from Venice


BASSANIO

Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither;
If that the youth of my new interest here
Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave,
I bid my very friends and countrymen,
Sweet Portia, welcome.


PORTIA

So do I, my lord:
They are entirely welcome.


LORENZO

I thank your honour. For my part, my lord,
My purpose was not to have seen you here;
But meeting with Salerio by the way,
He did entreat me, past all saying nay,
To come with him along.


SALERIO

I did, my lord;
And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio
Commends him to you.
Gives Bassanio a letter


BASSANIO

Ere I ope his letter,
I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth.


SALERIO

Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;
Nor well, unless in mind: his letter there
Will show you his estate.


GRATIANO

Nerissa, cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome.
Your hand, Salerio: what's the news from Venice?
How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?
I know he will be glad of our success;
We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.


SALERIO

I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.


PORTIA

There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper,
That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek:
Some dear friend dead; else nothing in the world
Could turn so much the constitution
Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!
With leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself,
And I must freely have the half of anything
That this same paper brings you.


BASSANIO

O sweet Portia,
Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words
That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,
When I did first impart my love to you,
I freely told you, all the wealth I had
Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;
And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,
Rating myself at nothing, you shall see
How much I was a braggart. When I told you
My state was nothing, I should then have told you
That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,
I have engaged myself to a dear friend,
Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,
To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;
The paper as the body of my friend,
And every word in it a gaping wound,
Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?
Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?
From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,
From Lisbon, Barbary and India?
And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch
Of merchant-marring rocks?


SALERIO

Not one, my lord.
Besides, it should appear, that if he had
The present money to discharge the Jew,
He would not take it. Never did I know
A creature, that did bear the shape of man,
So keen and greedy to confound a man:
He plies the duke at morning and at night,
And doth impeach the freedom of the state,
If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,
The duke himself, and the magnificoes
Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him;
But none can drive him from the envious plea
Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.


JESSICA

When I was with him I have heard him swear
To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,
That he would rather have Antonio's flesh
Than twenty times the value of the sum
That he did owe him: and I know, my lord,
If law, authority and power deny not,
It will go hard with poor Antonio.


PORTIA

Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?


BASSANIO

The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,
The best-condition'd and unwearied spirit
In doing courtesies, and one in whom
The ancient Roman honour more appears
Than any that draws breath in Italy.


PORTIA

What sum owes he the Jew?


BASSANIO

For me three thousand ducats.


PORTIA

What, no more?
Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;
Double six thousand, and then treble that,
Before a friend of this description
Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.
First go with me to church and call me wife,
And then away to Venice to your friend;
For never shall you lie by Portia's side
With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold
To pay the petty debt twenty times over:
When it is paid, bring your true friend along.
My maid Nerissa and myself meantime
Will live as maids and widows. Come, away!
For you shall hence upon your wedding-day:
Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer:
Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.
But let me hear the letter of your friend.


BASSANIO

[Reads]  Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all
miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate is
very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and since
in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all
debts are cleared between you and I, if I might but
see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your
pleasure: if your love do not persuade you to come,
let not my letter.


PORTIA

O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!


BASSANIO

Since I have your good leave to go away,
I will make haste: but, till I come again,
No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,
No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.
Exeunt

SCENE III. Venice. A street.

Enter SHYLOCK, SALARINO, ANTONIO, and Gaoler


SHYLOCK

Gaoler, look to him: tell not me of mercy;
This is the fool that lent out money gratis:
Gaoler, look to him.


ANTONIO

Hear me yet, good Shylock.


SHYLOCK

I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond:
I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.
Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause;
But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs:
The duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,
Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond
To come abroad with him at his request.


ANTONIO

I pray thee, hear me speak.


SHYLOCK

I'll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak:
I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.
I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,
To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield
To Christian intercessors. Follow not;
I'll have no speaking: I will have my bond.
Exit


SALARINO

It is the most impenetrable cur
That ever kept with men.


ANTONIO

Let him alone:
I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
He seeks my life; his reason well I know:
I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures
Many that have at times made moan to me;
Therefore he hates me.


SALARINO

I am sure the duke
Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.


ANTONIO

The duke cannot deny the course of law:
For the commodity that strangers have
With us in Venice, if it be denied,
Will much impeach the justice of his state;
Since that the trade and profit of the city
Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go:
These griefs and losses have so bated me,
That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
To-morrow to my bloody creditor.
Well, gaoler, on. Pray God, Bassanio come
To see me pay his debt, and then I care not!
Exeunt

SCENE IV. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.

Enter PORTIA, NERISSA, LORENZO, JESSICA, and BALTHASAR


LORENZO

Madam, although I speak it in your presence,
You have a noble and a true conceit
Of godlike amity; which appears most strongly
In bearing thus the absence of your lord.
But if you  knew to whom you show this honour,
How true a gentleman you send relief,
How dear a lover of my lord your husband,
I know you would be prouder of the work
Than customary bounty can enforce you.


PORTIA

I never did repent for doing good,
Nor shall not now: for in companions
That do converse and waste the time together,
Whose souls do bear an equal yoke Of love,
There must be needs a like proportion
Of lineaments, of manners and of spirit;
Which makes me think that this Antonio,
Being the bosom lover of my lord,
Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,
How little is the cost I have bestow'd
In purchasing the semblance of my soul
From out the state of hellish misery!
This comes too near the praising of myself;
Therefore no more of it: hear other things.
Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
The husbandry and manage of my house
Until my lord's return: for mine own part,
I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow
To live in prayer and contemplation,
Only attended by Nerissa here,
Until her husband and my lord's return:
There is a monastery two miles off;
And there will we abide. I do desire you
Not to deny this imposition;
The which my love and some necessity
Now lays upon you.


LORENZO

                  Madam, with all my heart;
I shall obey you in all fair commands.


PORTIA

My people do already know my mind,
And will acknowledge you and Jessica
In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.
And so farewell, till we shall meet again.


LORENZO

Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!


JESSICA

I wish your ladyship all heart's content.


PORTIA

I thank you for your wish, and am well pleased
To wish it back on you: fare you well Jessica.
Exeunt JESSICA and LORENZO
Now, Balthasar,
As I have ever found thee honest-true,
So let me find thee still. Take this same letter,
And use thou all the endeavour of a man
In speed to Padua: see thou render this
Into my cousin's hand, Doctor Bellario;
And, look, what notes and garments he doth give thee,
Bring them, I pray thee, with imagined speed
Unto the tranect, to the common ferry
Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,
But get thee gone: I shall be there before thee.


BALTHASAR

Madam, I go with all convenient speed.
Exit


PORTIA

Come on, Nerissa; I have work in hand
That you yet know not of: we'll see our husbands
Before they think of us.


NERISSA

Shall they see us?


PORTIA

They shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit,
That they shall think we are accomplished
With that we lack. I'll hold thee any wager,
When we are both accoutred like young men,
I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two,
And wear my dagger with the braver grace,
And speak between the change of man and boy
With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps
Into a manly stride, and speak of frays
Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,
How honourable ladies sought my love,
Which I denying, they fell sick and died;
I could not do withal; then I'll repent,
And wish for all that, that I had not killed them;
And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell,
That men shall swear I have discontinued school
Above a twelvemonth. I have within my mind
A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,
Which I will practise.


NERISSA

Why, shall we turn to men?


PORTIA

Fie, what a question's that,
If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!
But come, I'll tell thee all my whole device
When I am in my coach, which stays for us
At the park gate; and therefore haste away,
For we must measure twenty miles to-day.
Exeunt

SCENE V. The same. A garden.

Enter LAUNCELOT and JESSICA


LAUNCELOT

Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father
are to be laid upon the children: therefore, I
promise ye, I fear you. I was always plain with
you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter:
therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think you
are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do
you any good; and that is but a kind of bastard
hope neither.


JESSICA

And what hope is that, I pray thee?


LAUNCELOT

Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you
not, that you are not the Jew's daughter.


JESSICA

That were a kind of bastard hope, indeed: so the
sins of my mother should be visited upon me.


LAUNCELOT

Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and
mother: thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I
fall into Charybdis, your mother: well, you are
gone both ways.


JESSICA

I shall be saved by my husband; he hath made me a
Christian.


LAUNCELOT

Truly, the more to blame he: we were Christians
enow before; e'en as many as could well live, one by
another. This making Christians will raise the
price of hogs: if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we
shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.
Enter LORENZO


JESSICA

I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say: here he comes.


LORENZO

I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if
you thus get my wife into corners.


JESSICA

Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo: Launcelot and I
are out. He tells me flatly, there is no mercy for
me in heaven, because I am a Jew's daughter: and he
says, you are no good member of the commonwealth,
for in converting Jews to Christians, you raise the
price of pork.


LORENZO

I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than
you can the getting up of the negro's belly: the
Moor is with child by you, Launcelot.


LAUNCELOT

It is much that the Moor should be more than reason:
but if she be less than an honest woman, she is
indeed more than I took her for.


LORENZO

How every fool can play upon the word! I think the
best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence,
and discourse grow commendable in none only but
parrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.


LAUNCELOT

That is done, sir; they have all stomachs.


LORENZO

Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! then bid
them prepare dinner.


LAUNCELOT

That is done too, sir; only 'cover' is the word.


LORENZO

Will you cover then, sir?


LAUNCELOT

Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty.


LORENZO

Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show
the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray
tree, understand a plain man in his plain meaning:
go to thy fellows; bid them cover the table, serve
in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.


LAUNCELOT

For the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the
meat, sir, it shall be covered; for your coming in
to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and
conceits shall govern.
Exit


LORENZO

O dear discretion, how his words are suited!
The fool hath planted in his memory
An army of good words; and I do know
A many fools, that stand in better place,
Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word
Defy the matter. How cheerest thou, Jessica?
And now, good sweet, say thy opinion,
How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife?


JESSICA

Past all expressing. It is very meet
The Lord Bassanio live an upright life;
For, having such a blessing in his lady,
He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;
And if on earth he do not mean it, then
In reason he should never come to heaven
Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match
And on the wager lay two earthly women,
And Portia one, there must be something else
Pawn'd with the other, for the poor rude world
Hath not her fellow.


LORENZO

Even such a husband
Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.


JESSICA

Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.


LORENZO

I will anon: first, let us go to dinner.


JESSICA

Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.


LORENZO

No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk;
'	Then, howso'er thou speak'st, 'mong other things
I shall digest it.


JESSICA

                  Well, I'll set you forth.
Exeunt

ACT IV
SCENE I. Venice. A court of justice.

Enter the DUKE, the Magnificoes, ANTONIO, BASSANIO, GRATIANO, SALERIO, and others


DUKE

What, is Antonio here?


ANTONIO

Ready, so please your grace.


DUKE

I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer
A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch
uncapable of pity, void and empty
From any dram of mercy.


ANTONIO

I have heard
Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify
His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate
And that no lawful means can carry me
Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose
My patience to his fury, and am arm'd
To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,
The very tyranny and rage of his.


DUKE

Go one, and call the Jew into the court.


SALERIO

He is ready at the door: he comes, my lord.
Enter SHYLOCK


DUKE

Make room, and let him stand before our face.
Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,
That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice
To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought
Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;
And where thou now exact'st the penalty,
Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,
Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,
But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,
Forgive a moiety of the principal;
Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,
That have of late so huddled on his back,
Enow to press a royal merchant down
And pluck commiseration of his state
From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,
From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd
To offices of tender courtesy.
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.


SHYLOCK

I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose;
And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
To have the due and forfeit of my bond:
If you deny it, let the danger light
Upon your charter and your city's freedom.
You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have
A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:
But, say, it is my humour: is it answer'd?
What if my house be troubled with a rat
And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats
To have it baned? What, are you answer'd yet?
Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;
And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,
Cannot contain their urine: for affection,
Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood
Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:
As there is no firm reason to be render'd,
Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;
Why he, a harmless necessary cat;
Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force
Must yield to such inevitable shame
As to offend, himself being offended;
So can I give no reason, nor I will not,
More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing
I bear Antonio, that I follow thus
A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?


BASSANIO

This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,
To excuse the current of thy cruelty.


SHYLOCK

I am not bound to please thee with my answers.


BASSANIO

Do all men kill the things they do not love?


SHYLOCK

Hates any man the thing he would not kill?


BASSANIO

Every offence is not a hate at first.


SHYLOCK

What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?


ANTONIO

I pray you, think you question with the Jew:
You may as well go stand upon the beach
And bid the main flood bate his usual height;
You may as well use question with the wolf
Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;
You may as well forbid the mountain pines
To wag their high tops and to make no noise,
When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;
You may as well do anything most hard,
As seek to soften that--than which what's harder?--
His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,
Make no more offers, use no farther means,
But with all brief and plain conveniency
Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.


BASSANIO

For thy three thousand ducats here is six.


SHYLOCK

What judgment shall I dread, doing
Were in six parts and every part a ducat,
I would not draw them; I would have my bond.


DUKE

How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?


SHYLOCK

What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?
You have among you many a purchased slave,
Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,
You use in abject and in slavish parts,
Because you bought them: shall I say to you,
Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?
Why sweat they under burthens? let their beds
Be made as soft as yours and let their palates
Be season'd with such viands? You will answer
'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you:
The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,
Is dearly bought; 'tis mine and I will have it.
If you deny me, fie upon your law!
There is no force in the decrees of Venice.
I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?


DUKE

Upon my power I may dismiss this court,
Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,
Whom I have sent for to determine this,
Come here to-day.


SALERIO

                  My lord, here stays without
A messenger with letters from the doctor,
New come from Padua.


DUKE

Bring us the letter; call the messenger.


BASSANIO

Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!
The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,
Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.


ANTONIO

I am a tainted wether of the flock,
Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me
You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,
Than to live still and write mine epitaph.
Enter NERISSA, dressed like a lawyer's clerk


DUKE

Came you from Padua, from Bellario?


NERISSA

From both, my lord. Bellario greets your grace.
Presenting a letter


BASSANIO

Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?


SHYLOCK

To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.


GRATIANO

Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,
Thou makest thy knife keen; but no metal can,
No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness
Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?


SHYLOCK

No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.


GRATIANO

O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!
And for thy life let justice be accused.
Thou almost makest me waver in my faith
To hold opinion with Pythagoras,
That souls of animals infuse themselves
Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit
Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,
Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,
And, whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam,
Infused itself in thee; for thy desires
Are wolvish, bloody, starved and ravenous.


SHYLOCK

Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,
Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:
Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall
To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.


DUKE

This letter from Bellario doth commend
A young and learned doctor to our court.
Where is he?


NERISSA

                  He attendeth here hard by,
To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.


DUKE

With all my heart. Some three or four of you
Go give him courteous conduct to this place.
Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.


Clerk

[Reads]
Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of
your letter I am very sick: but in the instant that
your messenger came, in loving visitation was with
me a young doctor of Rome; his name is Balthasar. I
acquainted him with the cause in controversy between
the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned o'er
many books together: he is furnished with my
opinion; which, bettered with his own learning, the
greatness whereof I cannot enough commend, comes
with him, at my importunity, to fill up your grace's
request in my stead. I beseech you, let his lack of
years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend
estimation; for I never knew so young a body with so
old a head. I leave him to your gracious
acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his
commendation.


DUKE

You hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes:
And here, I take it, is the doctor come.
Enter PORTIA, dressed like a doctor of laws
Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?


PORTIA

I did, my lord.


DUKE

                  You are welcome: take your place.
Are you acquainted with the difference
That holds this present question in the court?


PORTIA

I am informed thoroughly of the cause.
Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?


DUKE

Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.


PORTIA

Is your name Shylock?


SHYLOCK

Shylock is my name.


PORTIA

Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;
Yet in such rule that the Venetian law
Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.
You stand within his danger, do you not?


ANTONIO

Ay, so he says.


PORTIA

                  Do you confess the bond?


ANTONIO

I do.


PORTIA

    Then must the Jew be merciful.


SHYLOCK

On what compulsion must I? tell me that.


PORTIA

The quality of mercy is not strain'd,
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown;
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty,
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
But mercy is above this sceptred sway;
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
It is an attribute to God himself;
And earthly power doth then show likest God's
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
That, in the course of justice, none of us
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much
To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.


SHYLOCK

My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,
The penalty and forfeit of my bond.


PORTIA

Is he not able to discharge the money?


BASSANIO

Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;
Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,
I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,
On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:
If this will not suffice, it must appear
That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,
Wrest once the law to your authority:
To do a great right, do a little wrong,
And curb this cruel devil of his will.


PORTIA

It must not be; there is no power in Venice
Can alter a decree established:
'Twill be recorded for a precedent,
And many an error by the same example
Will rush into the state: it cannot be.


SHYLOCK

A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!
O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!


PORTIA

I pray you, let me look upon the bond.


SHYLOCK

Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.


PORTIA

Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee.


SHYLOCK

An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?
No, not for Venice.


PORTIA

Why, this bond is forfeit;
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:
Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.


SHYLOCK

When it is paid according to the tenor.
It doth appear you are a worthy judge;
You know the law, your exposition
Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,
Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,
Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear
There is no power in the tongue of man
To alter me: I stay here on my bond.


ANTONIO

Most heartily I do beseech the court
To give the judgment.


PORTIA

Why then, thus it is:
You must prepare your bosom for his knife.


SHYLOCK

O noble judge! O excellent young man!


PORTIA

For the intent and purpose of the law
Hath full relation to the penalty,
Which here appeareth due upon the bond.


SHYLOCK

'Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!
How much more elder art thou than thy looks!


PORTIA

Therefore lay bare your bosom.


SHYLOCK

Ay, his breast:
So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?
'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.


PORTIA

It is so. Are there balance here to weigh
The flesh?


SHYLOCK

         I have them ready.


PORTIA

Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,
To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.


SHYLOCK

Is it so nominated in the bond?


PORTIA

It is not so express'd: but what of that?
'Twere good you do so much for charity.


SHYLOCK

I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.


PORTIA

You, merchant, have you any thing to say?


ANTONIO

But little: I am arm'd and well prepared.
Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;
For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
Than is her custom: it is still her use
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
An age of poverty; from which lingering penance
Of such misery doth she cut me off.
Commend me to your honourable wife:
Tell her the process of Antonio's end;
Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;
And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge
Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
And he repents not that he pays your debt;
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,
I'll pay it presently with all my heart.


BASSANIO

Antonio, I am married to a wife
Which is as dear to me as life itself;
But life itself, my wife, and all the world,
Are not with me esteem'd above thy life:
I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all
Here to this devil, to deliver you.


PORTIA

Your wife would give you little thanks for that,
If she were by, to hear you make the offer.


GRATIANO

I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love:
I would she were in heaven, so she could
Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.


NERISSA

'Tis well you offer it behind her back;
The wish would make else an unquiet house.


SHYLOCK

These be the Christian husbands. I have a daughter;
Would any of the stock of Barrabas
Had been her husband rather than a Christian!
Aside
We trifle time: I pray thee, pursue sentence.


PORTIA

A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine:
The court awards it, and the law doth give it.


SHYLOCK

Most rightful judge!


PORTIA

And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:
The law allows it, and the court awards it.


SHYLOCK

Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare!


PORTIA

Tarry a little; there is something else.
This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;
The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:'
Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;
But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed
One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods
Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate
Unto the state of Venice.


GRATIANO

O upright judge! Mark, Jew: O learned judge!


SHYLOCK

Is that the law?


PORTIA

                  Thyself shalt see the act:
For, as thou urgest justice, be assured
Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest.


GRATIANO

O learned judge! Mark, Jew: a learned judge!


SHYLOCK

I take this offer, then; pay the bond thrice
And let the Christian go.


BASSANIO

Here is the money.


PORTIA

Soft!
The Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste:
He shall have nothing but the penalty.


GRATIANO

O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!


PORTIA

Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more
But just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st more
Or less than a just pound, be it but so much
As makes it light or heavy in the substance,
Or the division of the twentieth part
Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn
But in the estimation of a hair,
Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.


GRATIANO

A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!
Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.


PORTIA

Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.


SHYLOCK

Give me my principal, and let me go.


BASSANIO

I have it ready for thee; here it is.


PORTIA

He hath refused it in the open court:
He shall have merely justice and his bond.


GRATIANO

A Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel!
I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.


SHYLOCK

Shall I not have barely my principal?


PORTIA

Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,
To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.


SHYLOCK

Why, then the devil give him good of it!
I'll stay no longer question.


PORTIA

Tarry, Jew:
The law hath yet another hold on you.
It is enacted in the laws of Venice,
If it be proved against an alien
That by direct or indirect attempts
He seek the life of any citizen,
The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive
Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
Comes to the privy coffer of the state;
And the offender's life lies in the mercy
Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice.
In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st;
For it appears, by manifest proceeding,
That indirectly and directly too
Thou hast contrived against the very life
Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd
The danger formerly by me rehearsed.
Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.


GRATIANO

Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself:
And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,
Thou hast not left the value of a cord;
Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge.


DUKE

That thou shalt see the difference of our spirits,
I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it:
For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;
The other half comes to the general state,
Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.


PORTIA

Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.


SHYLOCK

Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:
You take my house when you do take the prop
That doth sustain my house; you take my life
When you do take the means whereby I live.


PORTIA

What mercy can you render him, Antonio?


GRATIANO

A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake.


ANTONIO

So please my lord the duke and all the court
To quit the fine for one half of his goods,
I am content; so he will let me have
The other half in use, to render it,
Upon his death, unto the gentleman
That lately stole his daughter:
Two things provided more, that, for this favour,
He presently become a Christian;
The other, that he do record a gift,
Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd,
Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.


DUKE

He shall do this, or else I do recant
The pardon that I late pronounced here.


PORTIA

Art thou contented, Jew? what dost thou say?


SHYLOCK

I am content.


PORTIA

                  Clerk, draw a deed of gift.


SHYLOCK

I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;
I am not well: send the deed after me,
And I will sign it.


DUKE

Get thee gone, but do it.


GRATIANO

In christening shalt thou have two god-fathers:
Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,
To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.
Exit SHYLOCK


DUKE

Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.


PORTIA

I humbly do desire your grace of pardon:
I must away this night toward Padua,
And it is meet I presently set forth.


DUKE

I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.
Antonio, gratify this gentleman,
For, in my mind, you are much bound to him.
Exeunt Duke and his train


BASSANIO

Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend
Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted
Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof,
Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew,
We freely cope your courteous pains withal.


ANTONIO

And stand indebted, over and above,
In love and service to you evermore.


PORTIA

He is well paid that is well satisfied;
And I, delivering you, am satisfied
And therein do account myself well paid:
My mind was never yet more mercenary.
I pray you, know me when we meet again:
I wish you well, and so I take my leave.


BASSANIO

Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further:
Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,
Not as a fee: grant me two things, I pray you,
Not to deny me, and to pardon me.


PORTIA

You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
To ANTONIO
Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake;
To BASSANIO
And, for your love, I'll take this ring from you:
Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more;
And you in love shall not deny me this.


BASSANIO

This ring, good sir, alas, it is a trifle!
I will not shame myself to give you this.


PORTIA

I will have nothing else but only this;
And now methinks I have a mind to it.


BASSANIO

There's more depends on this than on the value.
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,
And find it out by proclamation:
Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.


PORTIA

I see, sir, you are liberal in offers
You taught me first to beg; and now methinks
You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.


BASSANIO

Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;
And when she put it on, she made me vow
That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.


PORTIA

That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
An if your wife be not a mad-woman,
And know how well I have deserved the ring,
She would not hold out enemy for ever,
For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!
Exeunt Portia and Nerissa


ANTONIO

My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring:
Let his deservings and my love withal
Be valued against your wife's commandment.


BASSANIO

Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him;
Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst,
Unto Antonio's house: away! make haste.
Exit Gratiano
Come, you and I will thither presently;
And in the morning early will we both
Fly toward Belmont: come, Antonio.
Exeunt

SCENE II. The same. A street.

Enter PORTIA and NERISSA


PORTIA

Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed
And let him sign it: we'll away to-night
And be a day before our husbands home:
This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.
Enter GRATIANO


GRATIANO

Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en
My Lord Bassanio upon more advice
Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat
Your company at dinner.


PORTIA

That cannot be:
His ring I do accept most thankfully:
And so, I pray you, tell him: furthermore,
I pray you, show my youth old Shylock's house.


GRATIANO

That will I do.


NERISSA

                  Sir, I would speak with you.
Aside to PORTIA
I'll see if I can get my husband's ring,
Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.


PORTIA

[Aside to NERISSA]  Thou mayst, I warrant.
We shall have old swearing
That they did give the rings away to men;
But we'll outface them, and outswear them too.
Aloud
Away! make haste: thou knowist where I will tarry.


NERISSA

Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?
Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. Belmont. Avenue to PORTIA'S house.

Enter LORENZO and JESSICA


LORENZO

The moon shines bright: in such a night as this,
When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees
And they did make no noise, in such a night
Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls
And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents,
Where Cressid lay that night.


JESSICA

In such a night
Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew
And saw the lion's shadow ere himself
And ran dismay'd away.


LORENZO

In such a night
Stood Dido with a willow in her hand
Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love
To come again to Carthage.


JESSICA

In such a night
Medea gather'd the enchanted herbs
That did renew old AEson.


LORENZO

In such a night
Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew
And with an unthrift love did run from Venice
As far as Belmont.


JESSICA

                  In such a night
Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,
Stealing her soul with many vows of faith
And ne'er a true one.


LORENZO

In such a night
Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,
Slander her love, and he forgave it her.


JESSICA

I would out-night you, did no body come;
But, hark, I hear the footing of a man.
Enter STEPHANO


LORENZO

Who comes so fast in silence of the night?


STEPHANO

A friend.


LORENZO

A friend! what friend? your name, I pray you, friend?


STEPHANO

Stephano is my name; and I bring word
My mistress will before the break of day
Be here at Belmont; she doth stray about
By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays
For happy wedlock hours.


LORENZO

Who comes with her?


STEPHANO

None but a holy hermit and her maid.
I pray you, is my master yet return'd?


LORENZO

He is not, nor we have not heard from him.
But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,
And ceremoniously let us prepare
Some welcome for the mistress of the house.
Enter LAUNCELOT


LAUNCELOT

Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!


LORENZO

Who calls?


LAUNCELOT

Sola! did you see Master Lorenzo?
Master Lorenzo, sola, sola!


LORENZO

Leave hollaing, man: here.


LAUNCELOT

Sola! where? where?


LORENZO

Here.


LAUNCELOT

Tell him there's a post come from my master, with
his horn full of good news: my master will be here
ere morning.
Exit


LORENZO

Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming.
And yet no matter: why should we go in?
My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,
Within the house, your mistress is at hand;
And bring your music forth into the air.
Exit Stephano
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
Here will we sit and let the sounds of music
Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night
Become the touches of sweet harmony.
Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven
Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:
There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
But in his motion like an angel sings,
Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;
Such harmony is in immortal souls;
But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.
Enter Musicians
Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn!
With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear,
And draw her home with music.
Music


JESSICA

I am never merry when I hear sweet music.


LORENZO

The reason is, your spirits are attentive:
For do but note a wild and wanton herd,
Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,
Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,
Which is the hot condition of their blood;
If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,
Or any air of music touch their ears,
You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,
Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze
By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet
Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods;
Since nought so stockish, hard and full of rage,
But music for the time doth change his nature.
The man that hath no music in himself,
Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;
The motions of his spirit are dull as night
And his affections dark as Erebus:
Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.
Enter PORTIA and NERISSA


PORTIA

That light we see is burning in my hall.
How far that little candle throws his beams!
So shines a good deed in a naughty world.


NERISSA

When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.


PORTIA

So doth the greater glory dim the less:
A substitute shines brightly as a king
Unto the king be by, and then his state
Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
Into the main of waters. Music! hark!


NERISSA

It is your music, madam, of the house.


PORTIA

Nothing is good, I see, without respect:
Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.


NERISSA

Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.


PORTIA

The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark,
When neither is attended, and I think
The nightingale, if she should sing by day,
When every goose is cackling, would be thought
No better a musician than the wren.
How many things by season season'd are
To their right praise and true perfection!
Peace, ho! the moon sleeps with Endymion
And would not be awaked.
Music ceases


LORENZO

That is the voice,
Or I am much deceived, of Portia.


PORTIA

He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,
By the bad voice.


LORENZO

                  Dear lady, welcome home.


PORTIA

We have been praying for our husbands' healths,
Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.
Are they return'd?


LORENZO

                  Madam, they are not yet;
But there is come a messenger before,
To signify their coming.


PORTIA

Go in, Nerissa;
Give order to my servants that they take
No note at all of our being absent hence;
Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.
A tucket sounds


LORENZO

Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet:
We are no tell-tales, madam; fear you not.


PORTIA

This night methinks is but the daylight sick;
It looks a little paler: 'tis a day,
Such as the day is when the sun is hid.
Enter BASSANIO, ANTONIO, GRATIANO, and their followers


BASSANIO

We should hold day with the Antipodes,
If you would walk in absence of the sun.


PORTIA

Let me give light, but let me not be light;
For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,
And never be Bassanio so for me:
But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.


BASSANIO

I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend.
This is the man, this is Antonio,
To whom I am so infinitely bound.


PORTIA

You should in all sense be much bound to him.
For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.


ANTONIO

No more than I am well acquitted of.


PORTIA

Sir, you are very welcome to our house:
It must appear in other ways than words,
Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.


GRATIANO

[To NERISSA]  By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;
In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk:
Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,
Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.


PORTIA

A quarrel, ho, already! what's the matter?


GRATIANO

About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring
That she did give me, whose posy was
For all the world like cutler's poetry
Upon  a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.'


NERISSA

What talk you of the posy or the value?
You swore to me, when I did give it you,
That you would wear it till your hour of death
And that it should lie with you in your grave:
Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,
You should have been respective and have kept it.
Gave it a judge's clerk! no, God's my judge,
The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it.


GRATIANO

He will, an if he live to be a man.


NERISSA

Ay, if a woman live to be a man.


GRATIANO

Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,
A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,
No higher than thyself; the judge's clerk,
A prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee:
I could not for my heart deny it him.


PORTIA

You were to blame, I must be plain with you,
To part so slightly with your wife's first gift:
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.
I gave my love a ring and made him swear
Never to part with it; and here he stands;
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth
That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,
You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:
An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.


BASSANIO

[Aside]  Why, I were best to cut my left hand off
And swear I lost the ring defending it.


GRATIANO

My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
Unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed
Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
That took some pains in writing, he begg'd mine;
And neither man nor master would take aught
But the two rings.


PORTIA

What ring gave you my lord?
Not that, I hope, which you received of me.


BASSANIO

If I could add a lie unto a fault,
I would deny it; but you see my finger
Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.


PORTIA

Even so void is your false heart of truth.
By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed
Until I see the ring.


NERISSA

Nor I in yours
Till I again see mine.


BASSANIO

Sweet Portia,
If you did know to whom I gave the ring,
If you did know for whom I gave the ring
And would conceive for what I gave the ring
And how unwillingly I left the ring,
When nought would be accepted but the ring,
You would abate the strength of your displeasure.


PORTIA

If you had known the virtue of the ring,
Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,
Or your own honour to contain the ring,
You would not then have parted with the ring.
What man is there so much unreasonable,
If you had pleased to have defended it
With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty
To urge the thing held as a ceremony?
Nerissa teaches me what to believe:
I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.


BASSANIO

No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,
No woman had it, but a civil doctor,
Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him
And suffer'd him to go displeased away;
Even he that did uphold the very life
Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?
I was enforced to send it after him;
I was beset with shame and courtesy;
My honour would not let ingratitude
So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;
For, by these blessed candles of the night,
Had you been there, I think you would have begg'd
The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.


PORTIA

Let not that doctor e'er come near my house:
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,
And that which you did swear to keep for me,
I will become as liberal as you;
I'll not deny him any thing I have,
No, not my body nor my husband's bed:
Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:
Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:
If you do not, if I be left alone,
Now, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,
I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.


NERISSA

And I his clerk; therefore be well advised
How you do leave me to mine own protection.


GRATIANO

Well, do you so; let not me take him, then;
For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.


ANTONIO

I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.


PORTIA

Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.


BASSANIO

Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;
And, in the hearing of these many friends,
I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,
Wherein I see myself--


PORTIA

Mark you but that!
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself;
In each eye, one: swear by your double self,
And there's an oath of credit.


BASSANIO

Nay, but hear me:
Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear
I never more will break an oath with thee.


ANTONIO

I once did lend my body for his wealth;
Which, but for him that had your husband's ring,
Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,
My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord
Will never more break faith advisedly.


PORTIA

Then you shall be his surety. Give him this
And bid him keep it better than the other.


ANTONIO

Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.


BASSANIO

By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!


PORTIA

I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio;
For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.


NERISSA

And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano;
For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,
In lieu of this last night did lie with me.


GRATIANO

Why, this is like the mending of highways
In summer, where the ways are fair enough:
What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?


PORTIA

Speak not so grossly. You are all amazed:
Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;
It comes from Padua, from Bellario:
There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,
Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here
Shall witness I set forth as soon as you
And even but now return'd; I have not yet
Enter'd my house. Antonio, you are welcome;
And I have better news in store for you
Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;
There you shall find three of your argosies
Are richly come to harbour suddenly:
You shall not know by what strange accident
I chanced on this letter.


ANTONIO

I am dumb.


BASSANIO

Were you the doctor and I knew you not?


GRATIANO

Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?


NERISSA

Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,
Unless he live until he be a man.


BASSANIO

Sweet doctor, you shall be my bed-fellow:
When I am absent, then lie with my wife.


ANTONIO

Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;
For here I read for certain that my ships
Are safely come to road.


PORTIA

How now, Lorenzo!
My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.


NERISSA

Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.
There do I give to you and Jessica,
From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,
After his death, of all he dies possess'd of.


LORENZO

Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way
Of starved people.


PORTIA

                  It is almost morning,
And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
Of these events at full. Let us go in;
And charge us there upon inter'gatories,
And we will answer all things faithfully.


GRATIANO

Let it be so: the first inter'gatory
That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,
Whether till the next night she had rather stay,
Or go to bed now, being two hours to day:
But were the day come, I should wish it dark,
That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.
Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing
So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.
Exeunt




The Merry Wives of Windsor

ACT I
SCENE I. Windsor. Before PAGE's house.

Enter SHALLOW, SLENDER, and SIR HUGH EVANS


SHALLOW

Sir Hugh, persuade me not; I will make a Star-
chamber matter of it: if he were twenty Sir John
Falstaffs, he shall not abuse Robert Shallow, esquire.


SLENDER

In the county of Gloucester, justice of peace and
'Coram.'


SHALLOW

Ay, cousin Slender, and 'Custalourum.


SLENDER

Ay, and 'Rato-lorum' too; and a gentleman born,
master parson; who writes himself 'Armigero,' in any
bill, warrant, quittance, or obligation, 'Armigero.'


SHALLOW

Ay, that I do; and have done any time these three
hundred years.


SLENDER

All his successors gone before him hath done't; and
all his ancestors that come after him may: they may
give the dozen white luces in their coat.


SHALLOW

It is an old coat.


SIR HUGH EVANS

The dozen white louses do become an old coat well;
it agrees well, passant; it is a familiar beast to
man, and signifies love.


SHALLOW

The luce is the fresh fish; the salt fish is an old coat.


SLENDER

I may quarter, coz.


SHALLOW

You may, by marrying.


SIR HUGH EVANS

It is marring indeed, if he quarter it.


SHALLOW

Not a whit.


SIR HUGH EVANS

Yes, py'r lady; if he has a quarter of your coat,
there is but three skirts for yourself, in my
simple conjectures: but that is all one. If Sir
John Falstaff have committed disparagements unto
you, I am of the church, and will be glad to do my
benevolence to make atonements and compremises
between you.


SHALLOW

The council shall bear it; it is a riot.


SIR HUGH EVANS

It is not meet the council hear a riot; there is no
fear of Got in a riot: the council, look you, shall
desire to hear the fear of Got, and not to hear a
riot; take your vizaments in that.


SHALLOW

Ha! o' my life, if I were young again, the sword
should end it.


SIR HUGH EVANS

It is petter that friends is the sword, and end it:
and there is also another device in my prain, which
peradventure prings goot discretions with it: there
is Anne Page, which is daughter to Master Thomas
Page, which is pretty virginity.


SLENDER

Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and speaks
small like a woman.


SIR HUGH EVANS

It is that fery person for all the orld, as just as
you will desire; and seven hundred pounds of moneys,
and gold and silver, is her grandsire upon his
death's-bed--Got deliver to a joyful resurrections!
--give, when she is able to overtake seventeen years
old: it were a goot motion if we leave our pribbles
and prabbles, and desire a marriage between Master
Abraham and Mistress Anne Page.


SLENDER

Did her grandsire leave her seven hundred pound?


SIR HUGH EVANS

Ay, and her father is make her a petter penny.


SLENDER

I know the young gentlewoman; she has good gifts.


SIR HUGH EVANS

Seven hundred pounds and possibilities is goot gifts.


SHALLOW

Well, let us see honest Master Page. Is Falstaff there?


SIR HUGH EVANS

Shall I tell you a lie? I do despise a liar as I do
despise one that is false, or as I despise one that
is not true. The knight, Sir John, is there; and, I
beseech you, be ruled by your well-willers. I will
peat the door for Master Page.
Knocks
What, hoa! Got pless your house here!


PAGE

[Within]  Who's there?
Enter PAGE


SIR HUGH EVANS

Here is Got's plessing, and your friend, and Justice
Shallow; and here young Master Slender, that
peradventures shall tell you another tale, if
matters grow to your likings.


PAGE

I am glad to see your worships well.
I thank you for my venison, Master Shallow.


SHALLOW

Master Page, I am glad to see you: much good do it
your good heart! I wished your venison better; it
was ill killed. How doth good Mistress Page?--and I
thank you always with my heart, la! with my heart.


PAGE

Sir, I thank you.


SHALLOW

Sir, I thank you; by yea and no, I do.


PAGE

I am glad to see you, good Master Slender.


SLENDER

How does your fallow greyhound, sir? I heard say he
was outrun on Cotsall.


PAGE

It could not be judged, sir.


SLENDER

You'll not confess, you'll not confess.


SHALLOW

That he will not. 'Tis your fault, 'tis your fault;
'tis a good dog.


PAGE

A cur, sir.


SHALLOW

Sir, he's a good dog, and a fair dog: can there be
more said? he is good and fair. Is Sir John
Falstaff here?


PAGE

Sir, he is within; and I would I could do a good
office between you.


SIR HUGH EVANS

It is spoke as a Christians ought to speak.


SHALLOW

He hath wronged me, Master Page.


PAGE

Sir, he doth in some sort confess it.


SHALLOW

If it be confessed, it is not redress'd: is not that
so, Master Page? He hath wronged me; indeed he
hath, at a word, he hath, believe me: Robert
Shallow, esquire, saith, he is wronged.


PAGE

Here comes Sir John.
Enter FALSTAFF, BARDOLPH, NYM, and PISTOL


FALSTAFF

Now, Master Shallow, you'll complain of me to the king?


SHALLOW

Knight, you have beaten my men, killed my deer, and
broke open my lodge.


FALSTAFF

But not kissed your keeper's daughter?


SHALLOW

Tut, a pin! this shall be answered.


FALSTAFF

I will answer it straight; I have done all this.
That is now answered.


SHALLOW

The council shall know this.


FALSTAFF

'Twere better for you if it were known in counsel:
you'll be laughed at.


SIR HUGH EVANS

Pauca verba, Sir John; goot worts.


FALSTAFF

Good worts! good cabbage. Slender, I broke your
head: what matter have you against me?


SLENDER

Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against you;
and against your cony-catching rascals, Bardolph,
Nym, and Pistol.


BARDOLPH

You Banbury cheese!


SLENDER

Ay, it is no matter.


PISTOL

How now, Mephostophilus!


SLENDER

Ay, it is no matter.


NYM

Slice, I say! pauca, pauca: slice! that's my humour.


SLENDER

Where's Simple, my man? Can you tell, cousin?


SIR HUGH EVANS

Peace, I pray you. Now let us understand. There is
three umpires in this matter, as I understand; that
is, Master Page, fidelicet Master Page; and there is
myself, fidelicet myself; and the three party is,
lastly and finally, mine host of the Garter.


PAGE

We three, to hear it and end it between them.


SIR HUGH EVANS

Fery goot: I will make a prief of it in my note-
book; and we will afterwards ork upon the cause with
as great discreetly as we can.


FALSTAFF

Pistol!


PISTOL

He hears with ears.


SIR HUGH EVANS

The tevil and his tam! what phrase is this, 'He
hears with ear'? why, it is affectations.


FALSTAFF

Pistol, did you pick Master Slender's purse?


SLENDER

Ay, by these gloves, did he, or I would I might
never come in mine own great chamber again else, of
seven groats in mill-sixpences, and two Edward
shovel-boards, that cost me two shilling and two
pence apiece of Yead Miller, by these gloves.


FALSTAFF

Is this true, Pistol?


SIR HUGH EVANS

No; it is false, if it is a pick-purse.


PISTOL

Ha, thou mountain-foreigner! Sir John and Master mine,
I combat challenge of this latten bilbo.
Word of denial in thy labras here!
Word of denial: froth and scum, thou liest!


SLENDER

By these gloves, then, 'twas he.


NYM

Be avised, sir, and pass good humours: I will say
'marry trap' with you, if you run the nuthook's
humour on me; that is the very note of it.


SLENDER

By this hat, then, he in the red face had it; for
though I cannot remember what I did when you made me
drunk, yet I am not altogether an ass.


FALSTAFF

What say you, Scarlet and John?


BARDOLPH

Why, sir, for my part I say the gentleman had drunk
himself out of his five sentences.


SIR HUGH EVANS

It is his five senses: fie, what the ignorance is!


BARDOLPH

And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashiered; and
so conclusions passed the careires.


SLENDER

Ay, you spake in Latin then too; but 'tis no
matter: I'll ne'er be drunk whilst I live again,
but in honest, civil, godly company, for this trick:
if I be drunk, I'll be drunk with those that have
the fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.


SIR HUGH EVANS

So Got udge me, that is a virtuous mind.


FALSTAFF

You hear all these matters denied, gentlemen; you hear it.
Enter ANNE PAGE, with wine; MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE, following


PAGE

Nay, daughter, carry the wine in; we'll drink within.
Exit ANNE PAGE


SLENDER

O heaven! this is Mistress Anne Page.


PAGE

How now, Mistress Ford!


FALSTAFF

Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well met:
by your leave, good mistress.
Kisses her


PAGE

Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we have a
hot venison pasty to dinner: come, gentlemen, I hope
we shall drink down all unkindness.
Exeunt all except SHALLOW, SLENDER, and SIR HUGH EVANS


SLENDER

I had rather than forty shillings I had my Book of
Songs and Sonnets here.
Enter SIMPLE
How now, Simple! where have you been? I must wait
on myself, must I? You have not the Book of Riddles
about you, have you?


SIMPLE

Book of Riddles! why, did you not lend it to Alice
Shortcake upon All-hallowmas last, a fortnight
afore Michaelmas?


SHALLOW

Come, coz; come, coz; we stay for you. A word with
you, coz; marry, this, coz: there is, as 'twere, a
tender, a kind of tender, made afar off by Sir Hugh
here. Do you understand me?


SLENDER

Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable; if it be so,
I shall do that that is reason.


SHALLOW

Nay, but understand me.


SLENDER

So I do, sir.


SIR HUGH EVANS

Give ear to his motions, Master Slender: I will
description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it.


SLENDER

Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says: I pray
you, pardon me; he's a justice of peace in his
country, simple though I stand here.


SIR HUGH EVANS

But that is not the question: the question is
concerning your marriage.


SHALLOW

Ay, there's the point, sir.


SIR HUGH EVANS

Marry, is it; the very point of it; to Mistress Anne Page.


SLENDER

Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any
reasonable demands.


SIR HUGH EVANS

But can you affection the 'oman? Let us command to
know that of your mouth or of your lips; for divers
philosophers hold that the lips is parcel of the
mouth. Therefore, precisely, can you carry your
good will to the maid?


SHALLOW

Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?


SLENDER

I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that
would do reason.


SIR HUGH EVANS

Nay, Got's lords and his ladies! you must speak
possitable, if you can carry her your desires
towards her.


SHALLOW

That you must. Will you, upon good dowry, marry her?


SLENDER

I will do a greater thing than that, upon your
request, cousin, in any reason.


SHALLOW

Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz: what I do
is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid?


SLENDER

I will marry her, sir, at your request: but if there
be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may
decrease it upon better acquaintance, when we are
married and have more occasion to know one another;
I hope, upon familiarity will grow more contempt:
but if you say, 'Marry her,' I will marry her; that
I am freely dissolved, and dissolutely.


SIR HUGH EVANS

It is a fery discretion answer; save the fall is in
the ort 'dissolutely:' the ort is, according to our
meaning, 'resolutely:' his meaning is good.


SHALLOW

Ay, I think my cousin meant well.


SLENDER

Ay, or else I would I might be hanged, la!


SHALLOW

Here comes fair Mistress Anne.
Re-enter ANNE PAGE
Would I were young for your sake, Mistress Anne!


ANNE PAGE

The dinner is on the table; my father desires your
worships' company.


SHALLOW

I will wait on him, fair Mistress Anne.


SIR HUGH EVANS

Od's plessed will! I will not be absence at the grace.
Exeunt SHALLOW and SIR HUGH EVANS


ANNE PAGE

Will't please your worship to come in, sir?


SLENDER

No, I thank you, forsooth, heartily; I am very well.


ANNE PAGE

The dinner attends you, sir.


SLENDER

I am not a-hungry, I thank you, forsooth. Go,
sirrah, for all you are my man, go wait upon my
cousin Shallow.
Exit SIMPLE
A justice of peace sometimes may be beholding to his
friend for a man. I keep but three men and a boy
yet, till my mother be dead: but what though? Yet I
live like a poor gentleman born.


ANNE PAGE

I may not go in without your worship: they will not
sit till you come.


SLENDER

I' faith, I'll eat nothing; I thank you as much as
though I did.


ANNE PAGE

I pray you, sir, walk in.


SLENDER

I had rather walk here, I thank you. I bruised
my shin th' other day with playing at sword and
dagger with a master of fence; three veneys for a
dish of stewed prunes; and, by my troth, I cannot
abide the smell of hot meat since. Why do your
dogs bark so? be there bears i' the town?


ANNE PAGE

I think there are, sir; I heard them talked of.


SLENDER

I love the sport well but I shall as soon quarrel at
it as any man in England. You are afraid, if you see
the bear loose, are you not?


ANNE PAGE

Ay, indeed, sir.


SLENDER

That's meat and drink to me, now. I have seen
Sackerson loose twenty times, and have taken him by
the chain; but, I warrant you, the women have so
cried and shrieked at it, that it passed: but women,
indeed, cannot abide 'em; they are very ill-favored
rough things.
Re-enter PAGE


PAGE

Come, gentle Master Slender, come; we stay for you.


SLENDER

I'll eat nothing, I thank you, sir.


PAGE

By cock and pie, you shall not choose, sir! come, come.


SLENDER

Nay, pray you, lead the way.


PAGE

Come on, sir.


SLENDER

Mistress Anne, yourself shall go first.


ANNE PAGE

Not I, sir; pray you, keep on.


SLENDER

I'll rather be unmannerly than troublesome.
You do yourself wrong, indeed, la!
Exeunt

SCENE II. The same.

Enter SIR HUGH EVANS and SIMPLE


SIR HUGH EVANS

Go your ways, and ask of Doctor Caius' house which
is the way: and there dwells one Mistress Quickly,
which is in the manner of his nurse, or his dry
nurse, or his cook, or his laundry, his washer, and
his wringer.


SIMPLE

Well, sir.


SIR HUGH EVANS

Nay, it is petter yet. Give her this letter; for it
is a 'oman that altogether's acquaintance with
Mistress Anne Page: and the letter is, to desire
and require her to solicit your master's desires to
Mistress Anne Page. I pray you, be gone: I will
make an end of my dinner; there's pippins and cheese to come.
Exeunt

SCENE III. A room in the Garter Inn.

Enter FALSTAFF, Host, BARDOLPH, NYM, PISTOL, and ROBIN


FALSTAFF

Mine host of the Garter!


Host

What says my bully-rook? speak scholarly and wisely.


FALSTAFF

Truly, mine host, I must turn away some of my
followers.


Host

Discard, bully Hercules; cashier: let them wag; trot, trot.


FALSTAFF

I sit at ten pounds a week.


Host

Thou'rt an emperor, Caesar, Keisar, and Pheezar. I
will entertain Bardolph; he shall draw, he shall
tap: said I well, bully Hector?


FALSTAFF

Do so, good mine host.


Host

I have spoke; let him follow.
To BARDOLPH
Let me see thee froth and lime: I am at a word; follow.
Exit


FALSTAFF

Bardolph, follow him. A tapster is a good trade:
an old cloak makes a new jerkin; a withered
serving-man a fresh tapster. Go; adieu.


BARDOLPH

It is a life that I have desired: I will thrive.


PISTOL

O base Hungarian wight! wilt thou the spigot wield?
Exit BARDOLPH


NYM

He was gotten in drink: is not the humour conceited?


FALSTAFF

I am glad I am so acquit of this tinderbox: his
thefts were too open; his filching was like an
unskilful singer; he kept not time.


NYM

The good humour is to steal at a minute's rest.


PISTOL

'Convey,' the wise it call. 'Steal!' foh! a fico
for the phrase!


FALSTAFF

Well, sirs, I am almost out at heels.


PISTOL

Why, then, let kibes ensue.


FALSTAFF

There is no remedy; I must cony-catch; I must shift.


PISTOL

Young ravens must have food.


FALSTAFF

Which of you know Ford of this town?


PISTOL

I ken the wight: he is of substance good.


FALSTAFF

My honest lads, I will tell you what I am about.


PISTOL

Two yards, and more.


FALSTAFF

No quips now, Pistol! Indeed, I am in the waist two
yards about; but I am now about no waste; I am about
thrift. Briefly, I do mean to make love to Ford's
wife: I spy entertainment in her; she discourses,
she carves, she gives the leer of invitation: I
can construe the action of her familiar style; and
the hardest voice of her behavior, to be Englished
rightly, is, 'I am Sir John Falstaff's.'


PISTOL

He hath studied her will, and translated her will,
out of honesty into English.


NYM

The anchor is deep: will that humour pass?


FALSTAFF

Now, the report goes she has all the rule of her
husband's purse: he hath a legion of angels.


PISTOL

As many devils entertain; and 'To her, boy,' say I.


NYM

The humour rises; it is good: humour me the angels.


FALSTAFF

I have writ me here a letter to her: and here
another to Page's wife, who even now gave me good
eyes too, examined my parts with most judicious
oeillades; sometimes the beam of her view gilded my
foot, sometimes my portly belly.


PISTOL

Then did the sun on dunghill shine.


NYM

I thank thee for that humour.


FALSTAFF

O, she did so course o'er my exteriors with such a
greedy intention, that the appetite of her eye did
seem to scorch me up like a burning-glass! Here's
another letter to her: she bears the purse too; she
is a region in Guiana, all gold and bounty. I will
be cheater to them both, and they shall be
exchequers to me; they shall be my East and West
Indies, and I will trade to them both. Go bear thou
this letter to Mistress Page; and thou this to
Mistress Ford: we will thrive, lads, we will thrive.


PISTOL

Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,
And by my side wear steel? then, Lucifer take all!


NYM

I will run no base humour: here, take the
humour-letter: I will keep the havior of reputation.


FALSTAFF

[To ROBIN]  Hold, sirrah, bear you these letters tightly;
Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.
Rogues, hence, avaunt! vanish like hailstones, go;
Trudge, plod away o' the hoof; seek shelter, pack!
Falstaff will learn the humour of the age,
French thrift, you rogues; myself and skirted page.
Exeunt FALSTAFF and ROBIN


PISTOL

Let vultures gripe thy guts! for gourd and fullam holds,
And high and low beguiles the rich and poor:
Tester I'll have in pouch when thou shalt lack,
Base Phrygian Turk!


NYM

I have operations which be humours of revenge.


PISTOL

Wilt thou revenge?


NYM

By welkin and her star!


PISTOL

With wit or steel?


NYM

With both the humours, I:
I will discuss the humour of this love to Page.


PISTOL

     And I to Ford shall eke unfold
How Falstaff, varlet vile,
His dove will prove, his gold will hold,
And his soft couch defile.


NYM

My humour shall not cool: I will incense Page to
deal with poison; I will possess him with
yellowness, for the revolt of mine is dangerous:
that is my true humour.


PISTOL

Thou art the Mars of malecontents: I second thee; troop on.
Exeunt

SCENE IV. A room in DOCTOR CAIUS' house.

Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY, SIMPLE, and RUGBY


MISTRESS QUICKLY

What, John Rugby! I pray thee, go to the casement,
and see if you can see my master, Master Doctor
Caius, coming. If he do, i' faith, and find any
body in the house, here will be an old abusing of
God's patience and the king's English.


RUGBY

I'll go watch.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Go; and we'll have a posset for't soon at night, in
faith, at the latter end of a sea-coal fire.
Exit RUGBY
An honest, willing, kind fellow, as ever servant
shall come in house withal, and, I warrant you, no
tell-tale nor no breed-bate: his worst fault is,
that he is given to prayer; he is something peevish
that way: but nobody but has his fault; but let
that pass. Peter Simple, you say your name is?


SIMPLE

Ay, for fault of a better.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

And Master Slender's your master?


SIMPLE

Ay, forsooth.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Does he not wear a great round beard, like a
glover's paring-knife?


SIMPLE

No, forsooth: he hath but a little wee face, with a
little yellow beard, a Cain-coloured beard.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

A softly-sprighted man, is he not?


SIMPLE

Ay, forsooth: but he is as tall a man of his hands
as any is between this and his head; he hath fought
with a warrener.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

How say you? O, I should remember him: does he not
hold up his head, as it were, and strut in his gait?


SIMPLE

Yes, indeed, does he.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Well, heaven send Anne Page no worse fortune! Tell
Master Parson Evans I will do what I can for your
master: Anne is a good girl, and I wish--
Re-enter RUGBY


RUGBY

Out, alas! here comes my master.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

We shall all be shent. Run in here, good young man;
go into this closet: he will not stay long.
Shuts SIMPLE in the closet
What, John Rugby! John! what, John, I say!
Go, John, go inquire for my master; I doubt
he be not well, that he comes not home.
Singing
And down, down, adown-a,  & c.
Enter DOCTOR CAIUS


DOCTOR CAIUS

Vat is you sing? I do not like des toys. Pray you,
go and vetch me in my closet un boitier vert, a box,
a green-a box: do intend vat I speak? a green-a box.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Ay, forsooth; I'll fetch it you.
Aside
I am glad he went not in himself: if he had found
the young man, he would have been horn-mad.


DOCTOR CAIUS

Fe, fe, fe, fe! ma foi, il fait fort chaud. Je
m'en vais a la cour--la grande affaire.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Is it this, sir?


DOCTOR CAIUS

Oui; mette le au mon pocket: depeche, quickly. Vere
is dat knave Rugby?


MISTRESS QUICKLY

What, John Rugby! John!


RUGBY

Here, sir!


DOCTOR CAIUS

You are John Rugby, and you are Jack Rugby. Come,
take-a your rapier, and come after my heel to the court.


RUGBY

'Tis ready, sir, here in the porch.


DOCTOR CAIUS

By my trot, I tarry too long. Od's me!
Qu'ai-j'oublie! dere is some simples in my closet,
dat I vill not for the varld I shall leave behind.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Ay me, he'll find the young man here, and be mad!


DOCTOR CAIUS

O diable, diable! vat is in my closet? Villain! larron!
Pulling SIMPLE out
Rugby, my rapier!


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Good master, be content.


DOCTOR CAIUS

Wherefore shall I be content-a?


MISTRESS QUICKLY

The young man is an honest man.


DOCTOR CAIUS

What shall de honest man do in my closet? dere is
no honest man dat shall come in my closet.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

I beseech you, be not so phlegmatic. Hear the truth
of it: he came of an errand to me from Parson Hugh.


DOCTOR CAIUS

Vell.


SIMPLE

Ay, forsooth; to desire her to--


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Peace, I pray you.


DOCTOR CAIUS

Peace-a your tongue. Speak-a your tale.


SIMPLE

To desire this honest gentlewoman, your maid, to
speak a good word to Mistress Anne Page for my
master in the way of marriage.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

This is all, indeed, la! but I'll ne'er put my
finger in the fire, and need not.


DOCTOR CAIUS

Sir Hugh send-a you? Rugby, baille me some paper.
Tarry you a little-a while.
Writes


MISTRESS QUICKLY

[Aside to SIMPLE]  I am glad he is so quiet: if he
had been thoroughly moved, you should have heard him
so loud and so melancholy. But notwithstanding,
man, I'll do you your master what good I can: and
the very yea and the no is, the French doctor, my
master,--I may call him my master, look you, for I
keep his house; and I wash, wring, brew, bake,
scour, dress meat and drink, make the beds and do
all myself,--


SIMPLE

[Aside to MISTRESS QUICKLY]  'Tis a great charge to
come under one body's hand.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

[Aside to SIMPLE]  Are you avised o' that? you
shall find it a great charge: and to be up early
and down late; but notwithstanding,--to tell you in
your ear; I would have no words of it,--my master
himself is in love with Mistress Anne Page: but
notwithstanding that, I know Anne's mind,--that's
neither here nor there.


DOCTOR CAIUS

You jack'nape, give-a this letter to Sir Hugh; by
gar, it is a shallenge: I will cut his troat in dee
park; and I will teach a scurvy jack-a-nape priest
to meddle or make. You may be gone; it is not good
you tarry here. By gar, I will cut all his two
stones; by gar, he shall not have a stone to throw
at his dog:
Exit SIMPLE


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Alas, he speaks but for his friend.


DOCTOR CAIUS

It is no matter-a ver dat: do not you tell-a me
dat I shall have Anne Page for myself? By gar, I
vill kill de Jack priest; and I have appointed mine
host of de Jarteer to measure our weapon. By gar, I
will myself have Anne Page.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Sir, the maid loves you, and all shall be well. We
must give folks leave to prate: what, the good-jer!


DOCTOR CAIUS

Rugby, come to the court with me. By gar, if I have
not Anne Page, I shall turn your head out of my
door. Follow my heels, Rugby.
Exeunt DOCTOR CAIUS and RUGBY


MISTRESS QUICKLY

You shall have An fool's-head of your own. No, I
know Anne's mind for that: never a woman in Windsor
knows more of Anne's mind than I do; nor can do more
than I do with her, I thank heaven.


FENTON

[Within]  Who's within there? ho!


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Who's there, I trow! Come near the house, I pray you.
Enter FENTON


FENTON

How now, good woman? how dost thou?


MISTRESS QUICKLY

The better that it pleases your good worship to ask.


FENTON

What news? how does pretty Mistress Anne?


MISTRESS QUICKLY

In truth, sir, and she is pretty, and honest, and
gentle; and one that is your friend, I can tell you
that by the way; I praise heaven for it.


FENTON

Shall I do any good, thinkest thou? shall I not lose my suit?


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Troth, sir, all is in his hands above: but
notwithstanding, Master Fenton, I'll be sworn on a
book, she loves you. Have not your worship a wart
above your eye?


FENTON

Yes, marry, have I; what of that?


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Well, thereby hangs a tale: good faith, it is such
another Nan; but, I detest, an honest maid as ever
broke bread: we had an hour's talk of that wart. I
shall never laugh but in that maid's company! But
indeed she is given too much to allicholy and
musing: but for you--well, go to.


FENTON

Well, I shall see her to-day. Hold, there's money
for thee; let me have thy voice in my behalf: if
thou seest her before me, commend me.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Will I? i'faith, that we will; and I will tell your
worship more of the wart the next time we have
confidence; and of other wooers.


FENTON

Well, farewell; I am in great haste now.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Farewell to your worship.
Exit FENTON
Truly, an honest gentleman: but Anne loves him not;
for I know Anne's mind as well as another does. Out
upon't! what have I forgot?

ACT II
SCENE I. Before PAGE'S house.

Enter MISTRESS PAGE, with a letter


MISTRESS PAGE

What, have I scaped love-letters in the holiday-
time of my beauty, and am I now a subject for them?
Let me see.
Reads
'Ask me no reason why I love you; for though
Love use Reason for his physician, he admits him
not for his counsellor. You are not young, no more
am I; go to then, there's sympathy: you are merry,
so am I; ha, ha! then there's more sympathy: you
love sack, and so do I; would you desire better
sympathy? Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page,--at
the least, if the love of soldier can suffice,--
that I love thee. I will not say, pity me; 'tis
not a soldier-like phrase: but I say, love me. By me,
Thine own true knight,
By day or night,
Or any kind of light,
With all his might
For thee to fight,    JOHN FALSTAFF'
What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked
world! One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with
age to show himself a young gallant! What an
unweighed behavior hath this Flemish drunkard
picked--with the devil's name!--out of my
conversation, that he dares in this manner assay me?
Why, he hath not been thrice in my company! What
should I say to him? I was then frugal of my
mirth: Heaven forgive me! Why, I'll exhibit a bill
in the parliament for the putting down of men. How
shall I be revenged on him? for revenged I will be,
as sure as his guts are made of puddings.
Enter MISTRESS FORD


MISTRESS FORD

Mistress Page! trust me, I was going to your house.


MISTRESS PAGE

And, trust me, I was coming to you. You look very
ill.


MISTRESS FORD

Nay, I'll ne'er believe that; I have to show to the contrary.


MISTRESS PAGE

Faith, but you do, in my mind.


MISTRESS FORD

Well, I do then; yet I say I could show you to the
contrary. O Mistress Page, give me some counsel!


MISTRESS PAGE

What's the matter, woman?


MISTRESS FORD

O woman, if it were not for one trifling respect, I
could come to such honour!


MISTRESS PAGE

Hang the trifle, woman! take the honour. What is
it? dispense with trifles; what is it?


MISTRESS FORD

If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so,
I could be knighted.


MISTRESS PAGE

What? thou liest! Sir Alice Ford! These knights
will hack; and so thou shouldst not alter the
article of thy gentry.


MISTRESS FORD

We burn daylight: here, read, read; perceive how I
might be knighted. I shall think the worse of fat
men, as long as I have an eye to make difference of
men's liking: and yet he would not swear; praised
women's modesty; and gave such orderly and
well-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness, that I
would have sworn his disposition would have gone to
the truth of his words; but they do no more adhere
and keep place together than the Hundredth Psalm to
the tune of 'Green Sleeves.' What tempest, I trow,
threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in his
belly, ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged
on him? I think the best way were to entertain him
with hope, till the wicked fire of lust have melted
him in his own grease. Did you ever hear the like?


MISTRESS PAGE

Letter for letter, but that the name of Page and
Ford differs! To thy great comfort in this mystery
of ill opinions, here's the twin-brother of thy
letter: but let thine inherit first; for, I
protest, mine never shall. I warrant he hath a
thousand of these letters, writ with blank space for
different names--sure, more,--and these are of the
second edition: he will print them, out of doubt;
for he cares not what he puts into the press, when
he would put us two. I had rather be a giantess,
and lie under Mount Pelion. Well, I will find you
twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man.


MISTRESS FORD

Why, this is the very same; the very hand, the very
words. What doth he think of us?


MISTRESS PAGE

Nay, I know not: it makes me almost ready to
wrangle with mine own honesty. I'll entertain
myself like one that I am not acquainted withal;
for, sure, unless he know some strain in me, that I
know not myself, he would never have boarded me in this fury.


MISTRESS FORD

'Boarding,' call you it? I'll be sure to keep him
above deck.


MISTRESS PAGE

So will I	if he come under my hatches, I'll never
to sea again. Let's be revenged on him: let's
appoint him a meeting; give him a show of comfort in
his suit and lead him on with a fine-baited delay,
till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter.


MISTRESS FORD

Nay, I will consent to act any villany against him,
that may not sully the chariness of our honesty. O,
that my husband saw this letter! it would give
eternal food to his jealousy.


MISTRESS PAGE

Why, look where he comes; and my good man too: he's
as far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause;
and that I hope is an unmeasurable distance.


MISTRESS FORD

You are the happier woman.


MISTRESS PAGE

Let's consult together against this greasy knight.
Come hither.
They retire
Enter FORD with PISTOL, and PAGE with NYM


FORD

Well, I hope it be not so.


PISTOL

Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs:
Sir John affects thy wife.


FORD

Why, sir, my wife is not young.


PISTOL

He wooes both high and low, both rich and poor,
Both young and old, one with another, Ford;
He loves the gallimaufry: Ford, perpend.


FORD

Love my wife!


PISTOL

With liver burning hot. Prevent, or go thou,
Like Sir Actaeon he, with Ringwood at thy heels:
O, odious is the name!


FORD

What name, sir?


PISTOL

The horn, I say. Farewell.
Take heed, have open eye, for thieves do foot by night:
Take heed, ere summer comes or cuckoo-birds do sing.
Away, Sir Corporal Nym!
Believe it, Page; he speaks sense.
Exit


FORD

[Aside]  I will be patient; I will find out this.


NYM

[To PAGE]  And this is true; I like not the humour
of lying. He hath wronged me in some humours: I
should have borne the humoured letter to her; but I
have a sword and it shall bite upon my necessity.
He loves your wife; there's the short and the long.
My name is Corporal Nym; I speak and I avouch; 'tis
true: my name is Nym and Falstaff loves your wife.
Adieu. I love not the humour of bread and cheese,
and there's the humour of it. Adieu.
Exit


PAGE

'The humour of it,' quoth a'! here's a fellow
frights English out of his wits.


FORD

I will seek out Falstaff.


PAGE

I never heard such a drawling, affecting rogue.


FORD

If I do find it: well.


PAGE

I will not believe such a Cataian, though the priest
o' the town commended him for a true man.


FORD

'Twas a good sensible fellow: well.


PAGE

How now, Meg!
MISTRESS PAGE and MISTRESS FORD come forward


MISTRESS PAGE

Whither go you, George? Hark you.


MISTRESS FORD

How now, sweet Frank! why art thou melancholy?


FORD

I melancholy! I am not melancholy. Get you home, go.


MISTRESS FORD

Faith, thou hast some crotchets in thy head. Now,
will you go, Mistress Page?


MISTRESS PAGE

Have with you. You'll come to dinner, George.
Aside to MISTRESS FORD
Look who comes yonder: she shall be our messenger
to this paltry knight.


MISTRESS FORD

[Aside to MISTRESS PAGE]  Trust me, I thought on her:
she'll fit it.
Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY


MISTRESS PAGE

You are come to see my daughter Anne?


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Ay, forsooth; and, I pray, how does good Mistress Anne?


MISTRESS PAGE

Go in with us and see: we have an hour's talk with
you.
Exeunt MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS FORD, and MISTRESS QUICKLY


PAGE

How now, Master Ford!


FORD

You heard what this knave told me, did you not?


PAGE

Yes: and you heard what the other told me?


FORD

Do you think there is truth in them?


PAGE

Hang 'em, slaves! I do not think the knight would
offer it: but these that accuse him in his intent
towards our wives are a yoke of his discarded men;
very rogues, now they be out of service.


FORD

Were they his men?


PAGE

Marry, were they.


FORD

I like it never the better for that. Does he lie at
the Garter?


PAGE

Ay, marry, does he. If he should intend this voyage
towards my wife, I would turn her loose to him; and
what he gets more of her than sharp words, let it
lie on my head.


FORD

I do not misdoubt my wife; but I would be loath to
turn them together. A man may be too confident: I
would have nothing lie on my head: I cannot be thus satisfied.


PAGE

Look where my ranting host of the Garter comes:
there is either liquor in his pate or money in his
purse when he looks so merrily.
Enter Host
How now, mine host!


Host

How now, bully-rook! thou'rt a gentleman.
Cavaleiro-justice, I say!
Enter SHALLOW


SHALLOW

I follow, mine host, I follow. Good even and
twenty, good Master Page! Master Page, will you go
with us? we have sport in hand.


Host

Tell him, cavaleiro-justice; tell him, bully-rook.


SHALLOW

Sir, there is a fray to be fought between Sir Hugh
the Welsh priest and Caius the French doctor.


FORD

Good mine host o' the Garter, a word with you.
Drawing him aside


Host

What sayest thou, my bully-rook?


SHALLOW

[To PAGE]  Will you go with us to behold it? My
merry host hath had the measuring of their weapons;
and, I think, hath appointed them contrary places;
for, believe me, I hear the parson is no jester.
Hark, I will tell you what our sport shall be.
They converse apart


Host

Hast thou no suit against my knight, my
guest-cavaleire?


FORD

None, I protest: but I'll give you a pottle of
burnt sack to give me recourse to him and tell him
my name is Brook; only for a jest.


Host

My hand, bully; thou shalt have egress and regress;
--said I well?--and thy name shall be Brook. It is
a merry knight. Will you go, An-heires?


SHALLOW

Have with you, mine host.


PAGE

I have heard the Frenchman hath good skill in
his rapier.


SHALLOW

Tut, sir, I could have told you more. In these times
you stand on distance, your passes, stoccadoes, and
I know not what: 'tis the heart, Master Page; 'tis
here, 'tis here. I have seen the time, with my long
sword I would have made you four tall fellows skip like rats.


Host

Here, boys, here, here! shall we wag?


PAGE

Have with you. I would rather hear them scold than fight.
Exeunt Host, SHALLOW, and PAGE


FORD

Though Page be a secure fool, an stands so firmly
on his wife's frailty, yet I cannot put off my
opinion so easily: she was in his company at Page's
house; and what they made there, I know not. Well,
I will look further into't: and I have a disguise
to sound Falstaff. If I find her honest, I lose not
my labour; if she be otherwise, 'tis labour well bestowed.
Exit

SCENE II. A room in the Garter Inn.

Enter FALSTAFF and PISTOL


FALSTAFF

I will not lend thee a penny.


PISTOL

Why, then the world's mine oyster.
Which I with sword will open.


FALSTAFF

Not a penny. I have been content, sir, you should
lay my countenance to pawn; I have grated upon my
good friends for three reprieves for you and your
coach-fellow Nym; or else you had looked through
the grate, like a geminy of baboons. I am damned in
hell for swearing to gentlemen my friends, you were
good soldiers and tall fellows; and when Mistress
Bridget lost the handle of her fan, I took't upon
mine honour thou hadst it not.


PISTOL

Didst not thou share? hadst thou not fifteen pence?


FALSTAFF

Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
endanger my soul gratis? At a word, hang no more
about me, I am no gibbet for you. Go. A short knife
and a throng! To your manor of Pickt-hatch! Go.
You'll not bear a letter for me, you rogue! you
stand upon your honour! Why, thou unconfinable
baseness, it is as much as I can do to keep the
terms of my honour precise: I, I, I myself
sometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left hand
and hiding mine honour in my necessity, am fain to
shuffle, to hedge and to lurch; and yet you, rogue,
will ensconce your rags, your cat-a-mountain
looks, your red-lattice phrases, and your
bold-beating oaths, under the shelter of your
honour! You will not do it, you!


PISTOL

I do relent: what would thou more of man?
Enter ROBIN


ROBIN

Sir, here's a woman would speak with you.


FALSTAFF

Let her approach.
Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Give your worship good morrow.


FALSTAFF

Good morrow, good wife.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Not so, an't please your worship.


FALSTAFF

Good maid, then.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

I'll be sworn,
As my mother was, the first hour I was born.


FALSTAFF

I do believe the swearer. What with me?


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Shall I vouchsafe your worship a word or two?


FALSTAFF

Two thousand, fair woman: and I'll vouchsafe thee
the hearing.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

There is one Mistress Ford, sir:--I pray, come a
little nearer this ways:--I myself dwell with master
Doctor Caius,--


FALSTAFF

Well, on: Mistress Ford, you say,--


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Your worship says very true: I pray your worship,
come a little nearer this ways.


FALSTAFF

I warrant thee, nobody hears; mine own people, mine
own people.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Are they so? God bless them and make them his servants!


FALSTAFF

Well, Mistress Ford; what of her?


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Why, sir, she's a good creature. Lord Lord! your
worship's a wanton! Well, heaven forgive you and all
of us, I pray!


FALSTAFF

Mistress Ford; come, Mistress Ford,--


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Marry, this is the short and the long of it; you
have brought her into such a canaries as 'tis
wonderful. The best courtier of them all, when the
court lay at Windsor, could never have brought her
to such a canary. Yet there has been knights, and
lords, and gentlemen, with their coaches, I warrant
you, coach after coach, letter after letter, gift
after gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so
rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold; and in
such alligant terms; and in such wine and sugar of
the best and the fairest, that would have won any
woman's heart; and, I warrant you, they could never
get an eye-wink of her: I had myself twenty angels
given me this morning; but I defy all angels, in
any such sort, as they say, but in the way of
honesty: and, I warrant you, they could never get
her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of
them all: and yet there has been earls, nay, which
is more, pensioners; but, I warrant you, all is one with her.


FALSTAFF

But what says she to me? be brief, my good
she-Mercury.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Marry, she hath received your letter, for the which
she thanks you a thousand times; and she gives you
to notify that her husband will be absence from his
house between ten and eleven.


FALSTAFF

Ten and eleven?


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see the
picture, she says, that you wot of: Master Ford,
her husband, will be from home. Alas! the sweet
woman leads an ill life with him: he's a very
jealousy man: she leads a very frampold life with
him, good heart.


FALSTAFF

Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her; I will
not fail her.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Why, you say well. But I have another messenger to
your worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty
commendations to you too: and let me tell you in
your ear, she's as fartuous a civil modest wife, and
one, I tell you, that will not miss you morning nor
evening prayer, as any is in Windsor, whoe'er be the
other: and she bade me tell your worship that her
husband is seldom from home; but she hopes there
will come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upon
a man: surely I think you have charms, la; yes, in truth.


FALSTAFF

Not I, I assure thee: setting the attractions of my
good parts aside I have no other charms.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Blessing on your heart for't!


FALSTAFF

But, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford's wife and
Page's wife acquainted each other how they love me?


MISTRESS QUICKLY

That were a jest indeed! they have not so little
grace, I hope: that were a trick indeed! but
Mistress Page would desire you to send her your
little page, of all loves: her husband has a
marvellous infection to the little page; and truly
Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in
Windsor leads a better life than she does: do what
she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go
to bed when she list, rise when she list, all is as
she will: and truly she deserves it; for if there
be a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must
send her your page; no remedy.


FALSTAFF

Why, I will.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Nay, but do so, then: and, look you, he may come and
go between you both; and in any case have a
nay-word, that you may know one another's mind, and
the boy never need to understand any thing; for
'tis not good that children should know any
wickedness: old folks, you know, have discretion,
as they say, and know the world.


FALSTAFF

Fare thee well: commend me to them both: there's
my purse; I am yet thy debtor. Boy, go along with
this woman.
Exeunt MISTRESS QUICKLY and ROBIN
This news distracts me!


PISTOL

This punk is one of Cupid's carriers:
Clap on more sails; pursue; up with your fights:
Give fire: she is my prize, or ocean whelm them all!
Exit


FALSTAFF

Sayest thou so, old Jack? go thy ways; I'll make
more of thy old body than I have done. Will they
yet look after thee? Wilt thou, after the expense
of so much money, be now a gainer? Good body, I
thank thee. Let them say 'tis grossly done; so it be
fairly done, no matter.
Enter BARDOLPH


BARDOLPH

Sir John, there's one Master Brook below would fain
speak with you, and be acquainted with you; and hath
sent your worship a morning's draught of sack.


FALSTAFF

Brook is his name?


BARDOLPH

Ay, sir.


FALSTAFF

Call him in.
Exit BARDOLPH
Such Brooks are welcome to me, that o'erflow such
liquor. Ah, ha! Mistress Ford and Mistress Page
have I encompassed you? go to; via!
Re-enter BARDOLPH, with FORD disguised


FORD

Bless you, sir!


FALSTAFF

And you, sir! Would you speak with me?


FORD

I make bold to press with so little preparation upon
you.


FALSTAFF

You're welcome. What's your will? Give us leave, drawer.
Exit BARDOLPH


FORD

Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent much; my name is Brook.


FALSTAFF

Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you.


FORD

Good Sir John, I sue for yours: not to charge you;
for I must let you understand I think myself in
better plight for a lender than you are: the which
hath something embolden'd me to this unseasoned
intrusion; for they say, if money go before, all
ways do lie open.


FALSTAFF

Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on.


FORD

Troth, and I have a bag of money here troubles me:
if you will help to bear it, Sir John, take all, or
half, for easing me of the carriage.


FALSTAFF

Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter.


FORD

I will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing.


FALSTAFF

Speak, good Master Brook: I shall be glad to be
your servant.


FORD

Sir, I hear you are a scholar,--I will be brief
with you,--and you have been a man long known to me,
though I had never so good means, as desire, to make
myself acquainted with you. I shall discover a
thing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mine
own imperfection: but, good Sir John, as you have
one eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded,
turn another into the register of your own; that I
may pass with a reproof the easier, sith you
yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender.


FALSTAFF

Very well, sir; proceed.


FORD

There is a gentlewoman in this town; her husband's
name is Ford.


FALSTAFF

Well, sir.


FORD

I have long loved her, and, I protest to you,
bestowed much on her; followed her with a doting
observance; engrossed opportunities to meet her;
fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly
give me sight of her; not only bought many presents
to give her, but have given largely to many to know
what she would have given; briefly, I have pursued
her as love hath pursued me; which hath been on the
wing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have
merited, either in my mind or, in my means, meed,
I am sure, I have received none; unless experience
be a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite
rate, and that hath taught me to say this:
'Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues;
Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.'


FALSTAFF

Have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands?


FORD

Never.


FALSTAFF

Have you importuned her to such a purpose?


FORD

Never.


FALSTAFF

Of what quality was your love, then?


FORD

Like a fair house built on another man's ground; so
that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place
where I erected it.


FALSTAFF

To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?


FORD

When I have told you that, I have told you all.
Some say, that though she appear honest to me, yet in
other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that
there is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir
John, here is the heart of my purpose: you are a
gentleman of excellent breeding, admirable
discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your
place and person, generally allowed for your many
war-like, court-like, and learned preparations.


FALSTAFF

O, sir!


FORD

Believe it, for you know it. There is money; spend
it, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only
give me so much of your time in exchange of it, as
to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this
Ford's wife: use your art of wooing; win her to
consent to you: if any man may, you may as soon as
any.


FALSTAFF

Would it apply well to the vehemency of your
affection, that I should win what you would enjoy?
Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.


FORD

O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on
the excellency of her honour, that the folly of my
soul dares not present itself: she is too bright to
be looked against. Now, could I could come to her
with any detection in my hand, my desires had
instance and argument to commend themselves: I
could drive her then from the ward of her purity,
her reputation, her marriage-vow, and a thousand
other her defences, which now are too too strongly
embattled against me. What say you to't, Sir John?


FALSTAFF

Master Brook, I will first make bold with your
money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a
gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford's wife.


FORD

O good sir!


FALSTAFF

I say you shall.


FORD

Want no money, Sir John; you shall want none.


FALSTAFF

Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall want
none. I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her
own appointment; even as you came in to me, her
assistant or go-between parted from me: I say I
shall be with her between ten and eleven; for at
that time the jealous rascally knave her husband
will be forth. Come you to me at night; you shall
know how I speed.


FORD

I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford,
sir?


FALSTAFF

Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him not:
yet I wrong him to call him poor; they say the
jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money; for the
which his wife seems to me well-favored. I will
use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue's coffer;
and there's my harvest-home.


FORD

I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him
if you saw him.


FALSTAFF

Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will
stare him out of his wits; I will awe him with my
cudgel: it shall hang like a meteor o'er the
cuckold's horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I
will predominate over the peasant, and thou shalt
lie with his wife. Come to me soon at night.
Ford's a knave, and I will aggravate his style;
thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave and
cuckold. Come to me soon at night.
Exit


FORD

What a damned Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is
ready to crack with impatience. Who says this is
improvident jealousy? my wife hath sent to him; the
hour is fixed; the match is made. Would any man
have thought this? See the hell of having a false
woman! My bed shall be abused, my coffers
ransacked, my reputation gnawn at; and I shall not
only receive this villanous wrong, but stand under
the adoption of abominable terms, and by him that
does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
well; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are
devils' additions, the names of fiends: but
Cuckold! Wittol!--Cuckold! the devil himself hath
not such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass: he
will trust his wife; he will not be jealous. I will
rather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh
the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my
aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling
gelding, than my wife with herself; then she plots,
then she ruminates, then she devises; and what they
think in their hearts they may effect, they will
break their hearts but they will effect. God be
praised for my jealousy! Eleven o'clock the hour.
I will prevent this, detect my wife, be revenged on
Falstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it;
better three hours too soon than a minute too late.
Fie, fie, fie! cuckold! cuckold! cuckold!

DOCTOR CAIUS

I pray you, bear vitness that me have stay six or
seven, two, tree hours for him, and he is no come.


SHALLOW

He is the wiser man, master doctor: he is a curer of
souls, and you a curer of bodies; if you should
fight, you go against the hair of your professions.
Is it not true, Master Page?


PAGE

Master Shallow, you have yourself been a great
fighter, though now a man of peace.


SHALLOW

Bodykins, Master Page, though I now be old and of
the peace, if I see a sword out, my finger itches to
make one. Though we are justices and doctors and
churchmen, Master Page, we have some salt of our
youth in us; we are the sons of women, Master Page.


PAGE

'Tis true, Master Shallow.


SHALLOW

It will be found so, Master Page. Master Doctor
Caius, I am come to fetch you home. I am sworn of
the peace: you have showed yourself a wise
physician, and Sir Hugh hath shown himself a wise
and patient churchman. You must go with me, master doctor.


Host

Pardon, guest-justice. A word, Mounseur Mockwater.

And, moreover, bully,--but first, master guest, and
Master Page, and eke Cavaleiro Slender, go you

Aside to them


PAGE

Sir Hugh is there, is he?


Host

He is there: see what humour he is in; and I will
bring the doctor about by the fields. Will it do well?


SHALLOW

We will do it.

SLENDER

Adieu, good master doctor.
Exeunt PAGE, SHALLOW, and SLENDER


DOCTOR CAIUS

By gar, me vill kill de priest; for he speak for a
jack-an-ape to Anne Page.


Host

Let him die: sheathe thy impatience, throw cold
water on thy choler: go about the fields with me
through Frogmore: I will bring thee where Mistress
Anne Page is, at a farm-house a-feasting; and thou
shalt woo her. Cried I aim? said I well?


DOCTOR CAIUS

By gar, me dank you for dat: by gar, I love you;
and I shall procure-a you de good guest, de earl,
de knight, de lords, de gentlemen, my patients.


Host

For the which I will be thy adversary toward Anne
Page. Said I well?


DOCTOR CAIUS

By gar, 'tis good; vell said.


Host

Let us wag, then.


DOCTOR CAIUS

Come at my heels, Jack Rugby.

ACT III
SCENE I. A field near Frogmore.

Enter SIR HUGH EVANS and SIMPLE


SIR HUGH EVANS

I pray you now, good master Slender's serving-man,
and friend Simple by your name, which way have you
looked for Master Caius, that calls himself doctor of physic?


SIMPLE

Marry, sir, the pittie-ward, the park-ward, every
way; old Windsor way, and every way but the town
way.


SIR HUGH EVANS

I most fehemently desire you you will also look that
way.


SIMPLE

I will, sir.
Exit


SIR HUGH EVANS

'Pless my soul, how full of chollors I am, and
trempling of mind! I shall be glad if he have
deceived me. How melancholies I am! I will knog
his urinals about his knave's costard when I have
good opportunities for the ork. 'Pless my soul!

Melodious birds sings madrigals;
There will we make our peds of roses,
And a thousand fragrant posies.

Mercy on me! I have a great dispositions to cry.

Melodious birds sing madrigals--

And a thousand vagram posies.

Re-enter SIMPLE


SIMPLE

Yonder he is coming, this way, Sir Hugh.


SIR HUGH EVANS

He's welcome.
Sings
To shallow rivers, to whose falls-
Heaven prosper the right! What weapons is he?


SIMPLE

No weapons, sir. There comes my master, Master
Shallow, and another gentleman, from Frogmore, over
the stile, this way.


SIR HUGH EVANS

Pray you, give me my gown; or else keep it in your arms.
Enter PAGE, SHALLOW, and SLENDER


SHALLOW

How now, master Parson! Good morrow, good Sir Hugh.
Keep a gamester from the dice, and a good student
from his book, and it is wonderful.


SLENDER

[Aside]  Ah, sweet Anne Page!


PAGE

'Save you, good Sir Hugh!


SIR HUGH EVANS

'Pless you from his mercy sake, all of you!


SHALLOW

What, the sword and the word! do you study them
both, master parson?


PAGE

And youthful still! in your doublet and hose this
raw rheumatic day!


SIR HUGH EVANS

There is reasons and causes for it.


PAGE

We are come to you to do a good office, master parson.


SIR HUGH EVANS

Fery well: what is it?


PAGE

Yonder is a most reverend gentleman, who, belike
having received wrong by some person, is at most
odds with his own gravity and patience that ever you
saw.


SHALLOW

I have lived fourscore years and upward; I never
heard a man of his place, gravity and learning, so
wide of his own respect.


SIR HUGH EVANS

What is he?


PAGE

I think you know him; Master Doctor Caius, the
renowned French physician.


SIR HUGH EVANS

Got's will, and his passion of my heart! I had as
lief you would tell me of a mess of porridge.


PAGE

Why?


SIR HUGH EVANS

He has no more knowledge in Hibocrates and Galen,
--and he is a knave besides; a cowardly knave as you
would desires to be acquainted withal.


PAGE

I warrant you, he's the man should fight with him.


SHALLOW

[Aside]  O sweet Anne Page!


SHALLOW

It appears so by his weapons. Keep them asunder:
here comes Doctor Caius.
Enter Host, DOCTOR CAIUS, and RUGBY


PAGE

Nay, good master parson, keep in your weapon.


SHALLOW

So do you, good master doctor.


Host

Disarm them, and let them question: let them keep
their limbs whole and hack our English.


DOCTOR CAIUS

I pray you, let-a me speak a word with your ear.
Vherefore vill you not meet-a me?


SIR HUGH EVANS

[Aside to DOCTOR CAIUS]  Pray you, use your patience:
in good time.


DOCTOR CAIUS

By gar, you are de coward, de Jack dog, John ape.


SIR HUGH EVANS

[Aside to DOCTOR CAIUS]  Pray you let us not be
laughing-stocks to other men's humours; I desire you
in friendship, and I will one way or other make you amends.
Aloud
I will knog your urinals about your knave's cockscomb
for missing your meetings and appointments.


DOCTOR CAIUS

Diable! Jack Rugby,--mine host de Jarteer,--have I
not stay for him to kill him? have I not, at de place
I did appoint?


SIR HUGH EVANS

As I am a Christians soul now, look you, this is the
place appointed: I'll be judgement by mine host of
the Garter.


Host

Peace, I say, Gallia and Gaul, French and Welsh,
soul-curer and body-curer!


DOCTOR CAIUS

Ay, dat is very good; excellent.


Host

Peace, I say! hear mine host of the Garter. Am I
politic? am I subtle? am I a Machiavel? Shall I
lose my doctor? no; he gives me the potions and the
motions. Shall I lose my parson, my priest, my Sir
Hugh? no; he gives me the proverbs and the
no-verbs. Give me thy hand, terrestrial; so. Give me
thy hand, celestial; so. Boys of art, I have
deceived you both; I have directed you to wrong
places: your hearts are mighty, your skins are
whole, and let burnt sack be the issue. Come, lay
their swords to pawn. Follow me, lads of peace;
follow, follow, follow.


SHALLOW

Trust me, a mad host. Follow, gentlemen, follow.


SLENDER

[Aside]  O sweet Anne Page!
Exeunt SHALLOW, SLENDER, PAGE, and Host


DOCTOR CAIUS

Ha, do I perceive dat? have you make-a de sot of
us, ha, ha?


SIR HUGH EVANS

This is well; he has made us his vlouting-stog. I
desire you that we may be friends; and let us knog
our prains together to be revenge on this same
scall, scurvy cogging companion, the host of the Garter.


DOCTOR CAIUS

By gar, with all my heart. He promise to bring me
where is Anne Page; by gar, he deceive me too.


SIR HUGH EVANS

Well, I will smite his noddles. Pray you, follow.
Exeunt

SCENE II. A street.

Enter MISTRESS PAGE and ROBIN


MISTRESS PAGE

Nay, keep your way, little gallant; you were wont to
be a follower, but now you are a leader. Whether
had you rather lead mine eyes, or eye your master's heels?


ROBIN

I had rather, forsooth, go before you like a man
than follow him like a dwarf.


MISTRESS PAGE

O, you are a flattering boy: now I see you'll be a courtier.
Enter FORD


FORD

Well met, Mistress Page. Whither go you?


MISTRESS PAGE

Truly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at home?


FORD

Ay; and as idle as she may hang together, for want
of company. I think, if your husbands were dead,
you two would marry.


MISTRESS PAGE

Be sure of that,--two other husbands.


FORD

Where had you this pretty weather-cock?


MISTRESS PAGE

I cannot tell what the dickens his name is my
husband had him of. What do you call your knight's
name, sirrah?


ROBIN

Sir John Falstaff.


FORD

Sir John Falstaff!


MISTRESS PAGE

He, he; I can never hit on's name. There is such a
league between my good man and he! Is your wife at
home indeed?


FORD

Indeed she is.


MISTRESS PAGE

By your leave, sir: I am sick till I see her.
Exeunt MISTRESS PAGE and ROBIN


FORD

Has Page any brains? hath he any eyes? hath he any
thinking? Sure, they sleep; he hath no use of them.
Why, this boy will carry a letter twenty mile, as
easy as a cannon will shoot point-blank twelve
score. He pieces out his wife's inclination; he
gives her folly motion and advantage: and now she's
going to my wife, and Falstaff's boy with her. A
man may hear this shower sing in the wind. And
Falstaff's boy with her! Good plots, they are laid;
and our revolted wives share damnation together.
Well; I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck
the borrowed veil of modesty from the so seeming
Mistress Page, divulge Page himself for a secure and
wilful Actaeon; and to these violent proceedings all
my neighbours shall cry aim.
Clock heard
The clock gives me my cue, and my assurance bids me
search: there I shall find Falstaff: I shall be
rather praised for this than mocked; for it is as
positive as the earth is firm that Falstaff is
there: I will go.
Enter PAGE, SHALLOW, SLENDER, Host, SIR HUGH EVANS, DOCTOR CAIUS, and RUGBY


SHALLOW

PAGE

& C

Well met, Master Ford.


FORD

Trust me, a good knot: I have good cheer at home;
and I pray you all go with me.


SHALLOW

I must excuse myself, Master Ford.


SLENDER

And so must I, sir: we have appointed to dine with
Mistress Anne, and I would not break with her for
more money than I'll speak of.


SHALLOW

We have lingered about a match between Anne Page and
my cousin Slender, and this day we shall have our answer.


SLENDER

I hope I have your good will, father Page.


PAGE

You have, Master Slender; I stand wholly for you:
but my wife, master doctor, is for you altogether.


DOCTOR CAIUS

Ay, be-gar; and de maid is love-a me: my nursh-a
Quickly tell me so mush.


Host

What say you to young Master Fenton? he capers, he
dances, he has eyes of youth, he writes verses, he
speaks holiday, he smells April and May: he will
carry't, he will carry't; 'tis in his buttons; he
will carry't.


PAGE

Not by my consent, I promise you. The gentleman is
of no having: he kept company with the wild prince
and Poins; he is of too high a region; he knows too
much. No, he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes
with the finger of my substance: if he take her,
let him take her simply; the wealth I have waits on
my consent, and my consent goes not that way.


FORD

I beseech you heartily, some of you go home with me
to dinner: besides your cheer, you shall have
sport; I will show you a monster. Master doctor,
you shall go; so shall you, Master Page; and you, Sir Hugh.


SHALLOW

Well, fare you well: we shall have the freer wooing
at Master Page's.
Exeunt SHALLOW, and SLENDER


DOCTOR CAIUS

Go home, John Rugby; I come anon.
Exit RUGBY


Host

Farewell, my hearts: I will to my honest knight
Falstaff, and drink canary with him.
Exit


FORD

[Aside]  I think I shall drink in pipe wine first
with him; I'll make him dance. Will you go, gentles?


All

Have with you to see this monster.
Exeunt

SCENE III. A room in FORD'S house.

Enter MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE


MISTRESS FORD

What, John! What, Robert!


MISTRESS PAGE

Quickly, quickly! is the buck-basket--


MISTRESS FORD

I warrant. What, Robin, I say!
Enter Servants with a basket


MISTRESS PAGE

Come, come, come.


MISTRESS FORD

Here, set it down.


MISTRESS PAGE

Give your men the charge; we must be brief.


MISTRESS FORD

Marry, as I told you before, John and Robert, be
ready here hard by in the brew-house: and when I
suddenly call you, come forth, and without any pause
or staggering take this basket on your shoulders:
that done, trudge with it in all haste, and carry
it among the whitsters in Datchet-mead, and there
empty it in the muddy ditch close by the Thames side.


MISTRESS PAGE

You will do it?


MISTRESS FORD

I ha' told them over and over; they lack no
direction. Be gone, and come when you are called.
Exeunt Servants


MISTRESS PAGE

Here comes little Robin.
Enter ROBIN


MISTRESS FORD

How now, my eyas-musket! what news with you?


ROBIN

My master, Sir John, is come in at your back-door,
Mistress Ford, and requests your company.


MISTRESS PAGE

You little Jack-a-Lent, have you been true to us?


ROBIN

Ay, I'll be sworn. My master knows not of your
being here and hath threatened to put me into
everlasting liberty if I tell you of it; for he
swears he'll turn me away.


MISTRESS PAGE

Thou'rt a good boy: this secrecy of thine shall be
a tailor to thee and shall make thee a new doublet
and hose. I'll go hide me.


MISTRESS FORD

Do so. Go tell thy master I am alone.
Exit ROBIN
Mistress Page, remember you your cue.


MISTRESS PAGE

I warrant thee; if I do not act it, hiss me.
Exit


MISTRESS FORD

Go to, then: we'll use this unwholesome humidity,
this gross watery pumpion; we'll teach him to know
turtles from jays.
Enter FALSTAFF


FALSTAFF

Have I caught thee, my heavenly jewel? Why, now let
me die, for I have lived long enough: this is the
period of my ambition: O this blessed hour!


MISTRESS FORD

O sweet Sir John!


FALSTAFF

Mistress Ford, I cannot cog, I cannot prate,
Mistress Ford. Now shall I sin in my wish: I would
thy husband were dead: I'll speak it before the
best lord; I would make thee my lady.


MISTRESS FORD

I your lady, Sir John! alas, I should be a pitiful lady!


FALSTAFF

Let the court of France show me such another. I see
how thine eye would emulate the diamond: thou hast
the right arched beauty of the brow that becomes the
ship-tire, the tire-valiant, or any tire of
Venetian admittance.


MISTRESS FORD

A plain kerchief, Sir John: my brows become nothing
else; nor that well neither.


FALSTAFF

By the Lord, thou art a traitor to say so: thou
wouldst make an absolute courtier; and the firm
fixture of thy foot would give an excellent motion
to thy gait in a semi-circled farthingale. I see
what thou wert, if Fortune thy foe were not, Nature
thy friend. Come, thou canst not hide it.


MISTRESS FORD

Believe me, there is no such thing in me.


FALSTAFF

What made me love thee? let that persuade thee
there's something extraordinary in thee. Come, I
cannot cog and say thou art this and that, like a
many of these lisping hawthorn-buds, that come like
women in men's apparel, and smell like Bucklersbury
in simple time; I cannot: but I love thee; none
but thee; and thou deservest it.


MISTRESS FORD

Do not betray me, sir. I fear you love Mistress Page.


FALSTAFF

Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by the
Counter-gate, which is as hateful to me as the reek
of a lime-kiln.


MISTRESS FORD

Well, heaven knows how I love you; and you shall one
day find it.


FALSTAFF

Keep in that mind; I'll deserve it.


MISTRESS FORD

Nay, I must tell you, so you do; or else I could not
be in that mind.


ROBIN

[Within]  Mistress Ford, Mistress Ford! here's
Mistress Page at the door, sweating and blowing and
looking wildly, and would needs speak with you presently.


FALSTAFF

She shall not see me: I will ensconce me behind the arras.


MISTRESS FORD

Pray you, do so: she's a very tattling woman.
FALSTAFF hides himself
Re-enter MISTRESS PAGE and ROBIN
What's the matter? how now!


MISTRESS PAGE

O Mistress Ford, what have you done? You're shamed,
you're overthrown, you're undone for ever!


MISTRESS FORD

What's the matter, good Mistress Page?


MISTRESS PAGE

O well-a-day, Mistress Ford! having an honest man
to your husband, to give him such cause of suspicion!


MISTRESS FORD

What cause of suspicion?


MISTRESS PAGE

What cause of suspicion! Out pon you! how am I
mistook in you!


MISTRESS FORD

Why, alas, what's the matter?


MISTRESS PAGE

Your husband's coming hither, woman, with all the
officers in Windsor, to search for a gentleman that
he says is here now in the house by your consent, to
take an ill advantage of his assence: you are undone.


MISTRESS FORD

'Tis not so, I hope.


MISTRESS PAGE

Pray heaven it be not so, that you have such a man
here! but 'tis most certain your husband's coming,
with half Windsor at his heels, to search for such a
one. I come before to tell you. If you know
yourself clear, why, I am glad of it; but if you
have a friend here convey, convey him out. Be not
amazed; call all your senses to you; defend your
reputation, or bid farewell to your good life for ever.


MISTRESS FORD

What shall I do? There is a gentleman my dear
friend; and I fear not mine own shame so much as his
peril: I had rather than a thousand pound he were
out of the house.


MISTRESS PAGE

For shame! never stand 'you had rather' and 'you
had rather:' your husband's here at hand, bethink
you of some conveyance: in the house you cannot
hide him. O, how have you deceived me! Look, here
is a basket: if he be of any reasonable stature, he
may creep in here; and throw foul linen upon him, as
if it were going to bucking: or--it is whiting-time
--send him by your two men to Datchet-mead.


MISTRESS FORD

He's too big to go in there. What shall I do?


FALSTAFF

[Coming forward]  Let me see't, let me see't, O, let
me see't! I'll in, I'll in. Follow your friend's
counsel. I'll in.


MISTRESS PAGE

What, Sir John Falstaff! Are these your letters, knight?


FALSTAFF

I love thee. Help me away. Let me creep in here.
I'll never--
Gets into the basket; they cover him with foul linen


MISTRESS PAGE

Help to cover your master, boy. Call your men,
Mistress Ford. You dissembling knight!


MISTRESS FORD

What, John! Robert! John!
Exit ROBIN
Re-enter Servants
Go take up these clothes here quickly. Where's the
cowl-staff? look, how you drumble! Carry them to
the laundress in Datchet-meat; quickly, come.
Enter FORD, PAGE, DOCTOR CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS


FORD

Pray you, come near: if I suspect without cause,
why then make sport at me; then let me be your jest;
I deserve it. How now! whither bear you this?


Servant

To the laundress, forsooth.


MISTRESS FORD

Why, what have you to do whither they bear it? You
were best meddle with buck-washing.


FORD

Buck! I would I could wash myself of the buck!
Buck, buck, buck! Ay, buck; I warrant you, buck;
and of the season too, it shall appear.
Exeunt Servants with the basket
Gentlemen, I have dreamed to-night; I'll tell you my
dream. Here, here, here be my keys: ascend my
chambers; search, seek, find out: I'll warrant
we'll unkennel the fox. Let me stop this way first.
Locking the door
So, now uncape.


PAGE

Good Master Ford, be contented: you wrong yourself too much.


FORD

True, Master Page. Up, gentlemen: you shall see
sport anon: follow me, gentlemen.
Exit


SIR HUGH EVANS

This is fery fantastical humours and jealousies.


DOCTOR CAIUS

By gar, 'tis no the fashion of France; it is not
jealous in France.


PAGE

Nay, follow him, gentlemen; see the issue of his search.
Exeunt PAGE, DOCTOR CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS


MISTRESS PAGE

Is there not a double excellency in this?


MISTRESS FORD

I know not which pleases me better, that my husband
is deceived, or Sir John.


MISTRESS PAGE

What a taking was he in when your husband asked who
was in the basket!


MISTRESS FORD

I am half afraid he will have need of washing; so
throwing him into the water will do him a benefit.


MISTRESS PAGE

Hang him, dishonest rascal! I would all of the same
strain were in the same distress.


MISTRESS FORD

I think my husband hath some special suspicion of
Falstaff's being here; for I never saw him so gross
in his jealousy till now.


MISTRESS PAGE

I will lay a plot to try that; and we will yet have
more tricks with Falstaff: his dissolute disease will
scarce obey this medicine.


MISTRESS FORD

Shall we send that foolish carrion, Mistress
Quickly, to him, and excuse his throwing into the
water; and give him another hope, to betray him to
another punishment?


MISTRESS PAGE

We will do it: let him be sent for to-morrow,
eight o'clock, to have amends.
Re-enter FORD, PAGE, DOCTOR CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS


FORD

I cannot find him: may be the knave bragged of that
he could not compass.


MISTRESS PAGE

[Aside to MISTRESS FORD]  Heard you that?


MISTRESS FORD

You use me well, Master Ford, do you?


FORD

Ay, I do so.


MISTRESS FORD

Heaven make you better than your thoughts!


FORD

Amen!


MISTRESS PAGE

You do yourself mighty wrong, Master Ford.


FORD

Ay, ay; I must bear it.


SIR HUGH EVANS

If there be any pody in the house, and in the
chambers, and in the coffers, and in the presses,
heaven forgive my sins at the day of judgment!


DOCTOR CAIUS

By gar, nor I too: there is no bodies.


PAGE

Fie, fie, Master Ford! are you not ashamed? What
spirit, what devil suggests this imagination? I
would not ha' your distemper in this kind for the
wealth of Windsor Castle.


FORD

'Tis my fault, Master Page: I suffer for it.


SIR HUGH EVANS

You suffer for a pad conscience: your wife is as
honest a 'omans as I will desires among five
thousand, and five hundred too.


DOCTOR CAIUS

By gar, I see 'tis an honest woman.


FORD

Well, I promised you a dinner. Come, come, walk in
the Park: I pray you, pardon me; I will hereafter
make known to you why I have done this. Come,
wife; come, Mistress Page. I pray you, pardon me;
pray heartily, pardon me.


PAGE

Let's go in, gentlemen; but, trust me, we'll mock
him. I do invite you to-morrow morning to my house
to breakfast: after, we'll a-birding together; I
have a fine hawk for the bush. Shall it be so?


FORD

Any thing.


SIR HUGH EVANS

If there is one, I shall make two in the company.


DOCTOR CAIUS

If dere be one or two, I shall make-a the turd.


FORD

Pray you, go, Master Page.


SIR HUGH EVANS

I pray you now, remembrance tomorrow on the lousy
knave, mine host.


DOCTOR CAIUS

Dat is good; by gar, with all my heart!


SIR HUGH EVANS

A lousy knave, to have his gibes and his mockeries!

SCENE IV. A room in PAGE'S house.

Enter FENTON and ANNE PAGE


FENTON

I see I cannot get thy father's love;
Therefore no more turn me to him, sweet Nan.


ANNE PAGE

Alas, how then?


FENTON

                  Why, thou must be thyself.
He doth object I am too great of birth--,
And that, my state being gall'd with my expense,
I seek to heal it only by his wealth:
Besides these, other bars he lays before me,
My riots past, my wild societies;
And tells me 'tis a thing impossible
I should love thee but as a property.


ANNE PAGE

May be he tells you true.


FENTON

No, heaven so speed me in my time to come!
Albeit I will confess thy father's wealth
Was the first motive that I woo'd thee, Anne:
Yet, wooing thee, I found thee of more value
Than stamps in gold or sums in sealed bags;
And 'tis the very riches of thyself
That now I aim at.


ANNE PAGE

                  Gentle Master Fenton,
Yet seek my father's love; still seek it, sir:
If opportunity and humblest suit
Cannot attain it, why, then,--hark you hither!
They converse apart
Enter SHALLOW, SLENDER, and MISTRESS QUICKLY


SHALLOW

Break their talk, Mistress Quickly: my kinsman shall
speak for himself.


SLENDER

I'll make a shaft or a bolt on't: 'slid, 'tis but
venturing.


SHALLOW

Be not dismayed.


SLENDER

No, she shall not dismay me: I care not for that,
but that I am afeard.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Hark ye; Master Slender would speak a word with you.


ANNE PAGE

I come to him.
Aside
This is my father's choice.
O, what a world of vile ill-favor'd faults
Looks handsome in three hundred pounds a-year!


MISTRESS QUICKLY

And how does good Master Fenton? Pray you, a word with you.


SHALLOW

She's coming; to her, coz. O boy, thou hadst a father!


SLENDER

I had a father, Mistress Anne; my uncle can tell you
good jests of him. Pray you, uncle, tell Mistress
Anne the jest, how my father stole two geese out of
a pen, good uncle.


SHALLOW

Mistress Anne, my cousin loves you.


SLENDER

Ay, that I do; as well as I love any woman in
Gloucestershire.


SHALLOW

He will maintain you like a gentlewoman.


SLENDER

Ay, that I will, come cut and long-tail, under the
degree of a squire.


SHALLOW

He will make you a hundred and fifty pounds jointure.


ANNE PAGE

Good Master Shallow, let him woo for himself.


SHALLOW

Marry, I thank you for it; I thank you for that good
comfort. She calls you, coz: I'll leave you.


ANNE PAGE

Now, Master Slender,--


SLENDER

Now, good Mistress Anne,--


ANNE PAGE

What is your will?


SLENDER

My will! 'od's heartlings, that's a pretty jest
indeed! I ne'er made my will yet, I thank heaven; I
am not such a sickly creature, I give heaven praise.


ANNE PAGE

I mean, Master Slender, what would you with me?


SLENDER

Truly, for mine own part, I would little or nothing
with you. Your father and my uncle hath made
motions: if it be my luck, so; if not, happy man be
his dole! They can tell you how things go better
than I can: you may ask your father; here he comes.
Enter PAGE and MISTRESS PAGE


PAGE

Now, Master Slender: love him, daughter Anne.
Why, how now! what does Master Fenton here?
You wrong me, sir, thus still to haunt my house:
I told you, sir, my daughter is disposed of.


FENTON

Nay, Master Page, be not impatient.


MISTRESS PAGE

Good Master Fenton, come not to my child.


PAGE

She is no match for you.


FENTON

Sir, will you hear me?


PAGE

No, good Master Fenton.
Come, Master Shallow; come, son Slender, in.
Knowing my mind, you wrong me, Master Fenton.
Exeunt PAGE, SHALLOW, and SLENDER


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Speak to Mistress Page.


FENTON

Good Mistress Page, for that I love your daughter
In such a righteous fashion as I do,
Perforce, against all cheques, rebukes and manners,
I must advance the colours of my love
And not retire: let me have your good will.


ANNE PAGE

Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool.


MISTRESS PAGE

I mean it not; I seek you a better husband.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

That's my master, master doctor.


ANNE PAGE

Alas, I had rather be set quick i' the earth
And bowl'd to death with turnips!


MISTRESS PAGE

Come, trouble not yourself. Good Master Fenton,
I will not be your friend nor enemy:
My daughter will I question how she loves you,
And as I find her, so am I affected.
Till then farewell, sir: she must needs go in;
Her father will be angry.


FENTON

Farewell, gentle mistress: farewell, Nan.
Exeunt MISTRESS PAGE and ANNE PAGE


MISTRESS QUICKLY

This is my doing, now: 'Nay,' said I, 'will you cast
away your child on a fool, and a physician? Look on
Master Fenton:' this is my doing.


FENTON

I thank thee; and I pray thee, once to-night
Give my sweet Nan this ring: there's for thy pains.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Now heaven send thee good fortune!

A kind heart he hath: a woman would run through
fire and water for such a kind heart. But yet I
would my master had Mistress Anne; or I would
Master Slender had her; or, in sooth, I would Master
Fenton had her; I will do what I can for them all
three; for so I have promised, and I'll be as good
as my word; but speciously for Master Fenton. Well,
I must of another errand to Sir John Falstaff from
my two mistresses: what a beast am I to slack it!
Exit

SCENE V. A room in the Garter Inn.

Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH


FALSTAFF

Bardolph, I say,--


BARDOLPH

Here, sir.


FALSTAFF

Go fetch me a quart of sack; put a toast in't.
Exit BARDOLPH
Have I lived to be carried in a basket, like a
barrow of butcher's offal, and to be thrown in the
Thames? Well, if I be served such another trick,
I'll have my brains ta'en out and buttered, and give
them to a dog for a new-year's gift. The rogues
slighted me into the river with as little remorse as
they would have drowned a blind bitch's puppies,
fifteen i' the litter: and you may know by my size
that I have a kind of alacrity in sinking; if the
bottom were as deep as hell, I should down. I had
been drowned, but that the shore was shelvy and
shallow,--a death that I abhor; for the water swells
a man; and what a thing should I have been when I
had been swelled! I should have been a mountain of mummy.
Re-enter BARDOLPH with sack


BARDOLPH

Here's Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with you.


FALSTAFF

Let me pour in some sack to the Thames water; for my
belly's as cold as if I had swallowed snowballs for
pills to cool the reins. Call her in.


BARDOLPH

Come in, woman!
Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY


MISTRESS QUICKLY

By your leave; I cry you mercy: give your worship
good morrow.


FALSTAFF

Take away these chalices. Go brew me a pottle of
sack finely.


BARDOLPH

With eggs, sir?


FALSTAFF

Simple of itself; I'll no pullet-sperm in my brewage.
Exit BARDOLPH
How now!


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Marry, sir, I come to your worship from Mistress Ford.


FALSTAFF

Mistress Ford! I have had ford enough; I was thrown
into the ford; I have my belly full of ford.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Alas the day! good heart, that was not her fault:
she does so take on with her men; they mistook their erection.


FALSTAFF

So did I mine, to build upon a foolish woman's promise.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Well, she laments, sir, for it, that it would yearn
your heart to see it. Her husband goes this morning
a-birding; she desires you once more to come to her
between eight and nine: I must carry her word
quickly: she'll make you amends, I warrant you.


FALSTAFF

Well, I will visit her: tell her so; and bid her
think what a man is: let her consider his frailty,
and then judge of my merit.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

I will tell her.


FALSTAFF

Do so. Between nine and ten, sayest thou?


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Eight and nine, sir.


FALSTAFF

Well, be gone: I will not miss her.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Peace be with you, sir.
Exit


FALSTAFF

I marvel I hear not of Master Brook; he sent me word
to stay within: I like his money well. O, here he comes.
Enter FORD


FORD

Bless you, sir!


FALSTAFF

Now, master Brook, you come to know what hath passed
between me and Ford's wife?


FORD

That, indeed, Sir John, is my business.


FALSTAFF

Master Brook, I will not lie to you: I was at her
house the hour she appointed me.


FORD

And sped you, sir?


FALSTAFF

Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.


FORD

How so, sir? Did she change her determination?


FALSTAFF

No, Master Brook; but the peaking Cornuto her
husband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual
'larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of our
encounter, after we had embraced, kissed, protested,
and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy;
and at his heels a rabble of his companions, thither
provoked and instigated by his distemper, and,
forsooth, to search his house for his wife's love.


FORD

What, while you were there?


FALSTAFF

While I was there.


FORD

And did he search for you, and could not find you?


FALSTAFF

You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes
in one Mistress Page; gives intelligence of Ford's
approach; and, in her invention and Ford's wife's
distraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket.


FORD

A buck-basket!


FALSTAFF

By the Lord, a buck-basket! rammed me in with foul
shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy
napkins; that, Master Brook, there was the rankest
compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril.


FORD

And how long lay you there?


FALSTAFF

Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have
suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good.
Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford's
knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their
mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to
Datchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders; met
the jealous knave their master in the door, who
asked them once or twice what they had in their
basket: I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knave
would have searched it; but fate, ordaining he
should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went he
for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But
mark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs
of three several deaths; first, an intolerable
fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten
bell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a good
bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to
point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,
like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes
that fretted in their own grease: think of that,--a
man of my kidney,--think of that,--that am as subject
to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution
and thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.
And in the height of this bath, when I was more than
half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be
thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,
in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of
that,--hissing hot,--think of that, Master Brook.


FORD

In good sadness, I am sorry that for my sake you
have sufferd all this. My suit then is desperate;
you'll undertake her no more?


FALSTAFF

Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have
been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her
husband is this morning gone a-birding: I have
received from her another embassy of meeting; 'twixt
eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.


FORD

'Tis past eight already, sir.


FALSTAFF

Is it? I will then address me to my appointment.
Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall
know how I speed; and the conclusion shall be
crowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall
have her, Master Brook; Master Brook, you shall
cuckold Ford.
Exit


FORD

Hum! ha! is this a vision? is this a dream? do I
sleep? Master Ford awake! awake, Master Ford!
there's a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford.
This 'tis to be married! this 'tis to have linen
and buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself
what I am: I will now take the lecher; he is at my
house; he cannot 'scape me; 'tis impossible he
should; he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse,
nor into a pepper-box: but, lest the devil that
guides him should aid him, I will search
impossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid,
yet to be what I would not shall not make me tame:
if I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb go
with me: I'll be horn-mad.
Exit

ACT IV
SCENE I. A street.

Enter MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS QUICKLY, and WILLIAM PAGE


MISTRESS PAGE

Is he at Master Ford's already, think'st thou?


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Sure he is by this, or will be presently: but,
truly, he is very courageous mad about his throwing
into the water. Mistress Ford desires you to come suddenly.


MISTRESS PAGE

I'll be with her by and by; I'll but bring my young
man here to school. Look, where his master comes;
'tis a playing-day, I see.
Enter SIR HUGH EVANS
How now, Sir Hugh! no school to-day?


SIR HUGH EVANS

No; Master Slender is let the boys leave to play.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Blessing of his heart!


MISTRESS PAGE

Sir Hugh, my husband says my son profits nothing in
the world at his book. I pray you, ask him some
questions in his accidence.


SIR HUGH EVANS

Come hither, William; hold up your head; come.


MISTRESS PAGE

Come on, sirrah; hold up your head; answer your
master, be not afraid.


SIR HUGH EVANS

William, how many numbers is in nouns?


WILLIAM PAGE

Two.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Truly, I thought there had been one number more,
because they say, ''Od's nouns.'


SIR HUGH EVANS

Peace your tattlings! What is 'fair,' William?


WILLIAM PAGE

Pulcher.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Polecats! there are fairer things than polecats, sure.


SIR HUGH EVANS

You are a very simplicity 'oman: I pray you peace.
What is 'lapis,' William?


WILLIAM PAGE

A stone.


SIR HUGH EVANS

And what is 'a stone,' William?


WILLIAM PAGE

A pebble.


SIR HUGH EVANS

No, it is 'lapis:' I pray you, remember in your prain.


WILLIAM PAGE

Lapis.


SIR HUGH EVANS

That is a good William. What is he, William, that
does lend articles?


WILLIAM PAGE

Articles are borrowed of the pronoun, and be thus
declined, Singulariter, nominativo, hic, haec, hoc.


SIR HUGH EVANS

Nominativo, hig, hag, hog; pray you, mark:
genitivo, hujus. Well, what is your accusative case?


WILLIAM PAGE

Accusativo, hinc.


SIR HUGH EVANS

I pray you, have your remembrance, child,
accusative, hung, hang, hog.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

'Hang-hog' is Latin for bacon, I warrant you.


SIR HUGH EVANS

Leave your prabbles, 'oman. What is the focative
case, William?


WILLIAM PAGE

O,--vocativo, O.


SIR HUGH EVANS

Remember, William; focative is caret.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

And that's a good root.


SIR HUGH EVANS

'Oman, forbear.


MISTRESS PAGE

Peace!


SIR HUGH EVANS

What is your genitive case plural, William?


WILLIAM PAGE

Genitive case!


SIR HUGH EVANS

Ay.


WILLIAM PAGE

Genitive,--horum, harum, horum.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Vengeance of Jenny's case! fie on her! never name
her, child, if she be a whore.


SIR HUGH EVANS

For shame, 'oman.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

You do ill to teach the child such words: he
teaches him to hick and to hack, which they'll do
fast enough of themselves, and to call 'horum:' fie upon you!


SIR HUGH EVANS

'Oman, art thou lunatics? hast thou no
understandings for thy cases and the numbers of the
genders? Thou art as foolish Christian creatures as
I would desires.


MISTRESS PAGE

Prithee, hold thy peace.


SIR HUGH EVANS

Show me now, William, some declensions of your pronouns.


WILLIAM PAGE

Forsooth, I have forgot.


SIR HUGH EVANS

It is qui, quae, quod: if you forget your 'quies,'
your 'quaes,' and your 'quods,' you must be
preeches. Go your ways, and play; go.


MISTRESS PAGE

He is a better scholar than I thought he was.


SIR HUGH EVANS

He is a good sprag memory. Farewell, Mistress Page.


MISTRESS PAGE

Adieu, good Sir Hugh.
Exit SIR HUGH EVANS
Get you home, boy. Come, we stay too long.
Exeunt

SCENE II. A room in FORD'S house.

Enter FALSTAFF and MISTRESS FORD


FALSTAFF

Mistress Ford, your sorrow hath eaten up my
sufferance. I see you are obsequious in your love,
and I profess requital to a hair's breadth; not
only, Mistress Ford, in the simple
office of love, but in all the accoutrement,
complement and ceremony of it. But are you
sure of your husband now?


MISTRESS FORD

He's a-birding, sweet Sir John.


MISTRESS PAGE

[Within]  What, ho, gossip Ford! what, ho!


MISTRESS FORD

Step into the chamber, Sir John.
Exit FALSTAFF
Enter MISTRESS PAGE


MISTRESS PAGE

How now, sweetheart! who's at home besides yourself?


MISTRESS FORD

Why, none but mine own people.


MISTRESS PAGE

Indeed!


MISTRESS FORD

No, certainly.
Aside to her
Speak louder.


MISTRESS PAGE

Truly, I am so glad you have nobody here.


MISTRESS FORD

Why?


MISTRESS PAGE

Why, woman, your husband is in his old lunes again:
he so takes on yonder with my husband; so rails
against all married mankind; so curses all Eve's
daughters, of what complexion soever; and so buffets
himself on the forehead, crying, 'Peer out, peer
out!' that any madness I ever yet beheld seemed but
tameness, civility and patience, to this his
distemper he is in now: I am glad the fat knight is not here.


MISTRESS FORD

Why, does he talk of him?


MISTRESS PAGE

Of none but him; and swears he was carried out, the
last time he searched for him, in a basket; protests
to my husband he is now here, and hath drawn him and
the rest of their company from their sport, to make
another experiment of his suspicion: but I am glad
the knight is not here; now he shall see his own foolery.


MISTRESS FORD

How near is he, Mistress Page?


MISTRESS PAGE

Hard by; at street end; he will be here anon.


MISTRESS FORD

I am undone! The knight is here.


MISTRESS PAGE

Why then you are utterly shamed, and he's but a dead
man. What a woman are you!--Away with him, away
with him! better shame than murder.


FORD

Which way should be go? how should I bestow him?
Shall I put him into the basket again?
Re-enter FALSTAFF


FALSTAFF

No, I'll come no more i' the basket. May I not go
out ere he come?


MISTRESS PAGE

Alas, three of Master Ford's brothers watch the door
with pistols, that none shall issue out; otherwise
you might slip away ere he came. But what make you here?


FALSTAFF

What shall I do? I'll creep up into the chimney.


MISTRESS FORD

There they always use to discharge their
birding-pieces. Creep into the kiln-hole.


FALSTAFF

Where is it?


MISTRESS FORD

He will seek there, on my word. Neither press,
coffer, chest, trunk, well, vault, but he hath an
abstract for the remembrance of such places, and
goes to them by his note: there is no hiding you in the house.


FALSTAFF

I'll go out then.


MISTRESS PAGE

If you go out in your own semblance, you die, Sir
John. Unless you go out disguised--


MISTRESS FORD

How might we disguise him?


MISTRESS PAGE

Alas the day, I know not! There is no woman's gown
big enough for him otherwise he might put on a hat,
a muffler and a kerchief, and so escape.


FALSTAFF

Good hearts, devise something: any extremity rather
than a mischief.


MISTRESS FORD

My maid's aunt, the fat woman of Brentford, has a
gown above.


MISTRESS PAGE

On my word, it will serve him; she's as big as he
is: and there's her thrummed hat and her muffler
too. Run up, Sir John.


MISTRESS FORD

Go, go, sweet Sir John: Mistress Page and I will
look some linen for your head.


MISTRESS PAGE

Quick, quick! we'll come dress you straight: put
on the gown the while.
Exit FALSTAFF


MISTRESS FORD

I would my husband would meet him in this shape: he
cannot abide the old woman of Brentford; he swears
she's a witch; forbade her my house and hath
threatened to beat her.


MISTRESS PAGE

Heaven guide him to thy husband's cudgel, and the
devil guide his cudgel afterwards!


MISTRESS FORD

But is my husband coming?


MISTRESS PAGE

Ah, in good sadness, is he; and talks of the basket
too, howsoever he hath had intelligence.


MISTRESS FORD

We'll try that; for I'll appoint my men to carry the
basket again, to meet him at the door with it, as
they did last time.


MISTRESS PAGE

Nay, but he'll be here presently: let's go dress him
like the witch of Brentford.


MISTRESS FORD

I'll first direct my men what they shall do with the
basket. Go up; I'll bring linen for him straight.
Exit


MISTRESS PAGE

Hang him, dishonest varlet! we cannot misuse him enough.
We'll leave a proof, by that which we will do,
Wives may be merry, and yet honest too:
We do not act that often jest and laugh;
'Tis old, but true, Still swine eat all the draff.
Exit
Re-enter MISTRESS FORD with two Servants


MISTRESS FORD

Go, sirs, take the basket again on your shoulders:
your master is hard at door; if he bid you set it
down, obey him: quickly, dispatch.
Exit


First Servant

Come, come, take it up.


Second Servant

Pray heaven it be not full of knight again.


First Servant

I hope not; I had as lief bear so much lead.
Enter FORD, PAGE, SHALLOW, DOCTOR CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS


FORD

Ay, but if it prove true, Master Page, have you any
way then to unfool me again? Set down the basket,
villain! Somebody call my wife. Youth in a basket!
O you panderly rascals! there's a knot, a ging, a
pack, a conspiracy against me: now shall the devil
be shamed. What, wife, I say! Come, come forth!
Behold what honest clothes you send forth to bleaching!


PAGE

Why, this passes, Master Ford; you are not to go
loose any longer; you must be pinioned.


SIR HUGH EVANS

Why, this is lunatics! this is mad as a mad dog!


SHALLOW

Indeed, Master Ford, this is not well, indeed.


FORD

So say I too, sir.
Re-enter MISTRESS FORD
Come hither, Mistress Ford; Mistress Ford the honest
woman, the modest wife, the virtuous creature, that
hath the jealous fool to her husband! I suspect
without cause, mistress, do I?


MISTRESS FORD

Heaven be my witness you do, if you suspect me in
any dishonesty.


FORD

Well said, brazen-face! hold it out. Come forth, sirrah!
Pulling clothes out of the basket


PAGE

This passes!


MISTRESS FORD

Are you not ashamed? let the clothes alone.


FORD

I shall find you anon.


SIR HUGH EVANS

'Tis unreasonable! Will you take up your wife's
clothes? Come away.


FORD

Empty the basket, I say!


MISTRESS FORD

Why, man, why?


FORD

Master Page, as I am a man, there was one conveyed
out of my house yesterday in this basket: why may
not he be there again? In my house I am sure he is:
my intelligence is true; my jealousy is reasonable.
Pluck me out all the linen.


MISTRESS FORD

If you find a man there, he shall die a flea's death.


PAGE

Here's no man.


SHALLOW

By my fidelity, this is not well, Master Ford; this
wrongs you.


SIR HUGH EVANS

Master Ford, you must pray, and not follow the
imaginations of your own heart: this is jealousies.


FORD

Well, he's not here I seek for.


PAGE

No, nor nowhere else but in your brain.


FORD

Help to search my house this one time. If I find
not what I seek, show no colour for my extremity; let
me for ever be your table-sport; let them say of
me, 'As jealous as Ford, Chat searched a hollow
walnut for his wife's leman.' Satisfy me once more;
once more search with me.


MISTRESS FORD

What, ho, Mistress Page! come you and the old woman
down; my husband will come into the chamber.


FORD

Old woman! what old woman's that?


MISTRESS FORD

Nay, it is my maid's aunt of Brentford.


FORD

A witch, a quean, an old cozening quean! Have I not
forbid her my house? She comes of errands, does
she? We are simple men; we do not know what's
brought to pass under the profession of
fortune-telling. She works by charms, by spells,
by the figure, and such daubery as this is, beyond
our element we know nothing. Come down, you witch,
you hag, you; come down, I say!


MISTRESS FORD

Nay, good, sweet husband! Good gentlemen, let him
not strike the old woman.
Re-enter FALSTAFF in woman's clothes, and MISTRESS PAGE


MISTRESS PAGE

Come, Mother Prat; come, give me your hand.


FORD

I'll prat her.
Beating him
Out of my door, you witch, you hag, you baggage, you
polecat, you runyon! out, out! I'll conjure you,
I'll fortune-tell you.
Exit FALSTAFF


MISTRESS PAGE

Are you not ashamed? I think you have killed the
poor woman.


MISTRESS FORD

Nay, he will do it. 'Tis a goodly credit for you.


FORD

Hang her, witch!


SIR HUGH EVANS

By the yea and no, I think the 'oman is a witch
indeed: I like not when a 'oman has a great peard;
I spy a great peard under his muffler.


FORD

Will you follow, gentlemen? I beseech you, follow;
see but the issue of my jealousy: if I cry out thus
upon no trail, never trust me when I open again.


PAGE

Let's obey his humour a little further: come,
gentlemen.
Exeunt FORD, PAGE, SHALLOW, DOCTOR CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS


MISTRESS PAGE

Trust me, he beat him most pitifully.


MISTRESS FORD

Nay, by the mass, that he did not; he beat him most
unpitifully, methought.


MISTRESS PAGE

I'll have the cudgel hallowed and hung o'er the
altar; it hath done meritorious service.


MISTRESS FORD

What think you? may we, with the warrant of
womanhood and the witness of a good conscience,
pursue him with any further revenge?


MISTRESS PAGE

The spirit of wantonness is, sure, scared out of
him: if the devil have him not in fee-simple, with
fine and recovery, he will never, I think, in the
way of waste, attempt us again.


MISTRESS FORD

Shall we tell our husbands how we have served him?


MISTRESS PAGE

Yes, by all means; if it be but to scrape the
figures out of your husband's brains. If they can
find in their hearts the poor unvirtuous fat knight
shall be any further afflicted, we two will still be
the ministers.


MISTRESS FORD

I'll warrant they'll have him publicly shamed: and
methinks there would be no period to the jest,
should he not be publicly shamed.


MISTRESS PAGE

Come, to the forge with it then; shape it: I would
not have things cool.
Exeunt

SCENE III. A room in the Garter Inn.

Enter Host and BARDOLPH


BARDOLPH

Sir, the Germans desire to have three of your
horses: the duke himself will be to-morrow at
court, and they are going to meet him.


Host

What duke should that be comes so secretly? I hear
not of him in the court. Let me speak with the
gentlemen: they speak English?


BARDOLPH

Ay, sir; I'll call them to you.


Host

They shall have my horses; but I'll make them pay;
I'll sauce them: they have had my house a week at
command; I have turned away my other guests: they
must come off; I'll sauce them. Come.
Exeunt

SCENE IV. A room in FORD'S house.

Enter PAGE, FORD, MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS FORD, and SIR HUGH EVANS


SIR HUGH EVANS

'Tis one of the best discretions of a 'oman as ever
I did look upon.


PAGE

And did he send you both these letters at an instant?


MISTRESS PAGE

Within a quarter of an hour.


FORD

Pardon me, wife. Henceforth do what thou wilt;
I rather will suspect the sun with cold
Than thee with wantonness: now doth thy honour stand
In him that was of late an heretic,
As firm as faith.


PAGE

'Tis well, 'tis well; no more:
Be not as extreme in submission
As in offence.
But let our plot go forward: let our wives
Yet once again, to make us public sport,
Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow,
Where we may take him and disgrace him for it.


FORD

There is no better way than that they spoke of.


PAGE

How? to send him word they'll meet him in the park
at midnight? Fie, fie! he'll never come.


SIR HUGH EVANS

You say he has been thrown in the rivers and has
been grievously peaten as an old 'oman: methinks
there should be terrors in him that he should not
come; methinks his flesh is punished, he shall have
no desires.


PAGE

So think I too.


MISTRESS FORD

Devise but how you'll use him when he comes,
And let us two devise to bring him thither.


MISTRESS PAGE

There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter,
Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest,
Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,
Walk round about an oak, with great ragg'd horns;
And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle
And makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain
In a most hideous and dreadful manner:
You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know
The superstitious idle-headed eld
Received and did deliver to our age
This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.


PAGE

Why, yet there want not many that do fear
In deep of night to walk by this Herne's oak:
But what of this?


MISTRESS FORD

                  Marry, this is our device;
That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us.


PAGE

Well, let it not be doubted but he'll come:
And in this shape when you have brought him thither,
What shall be done with him? what is your plot?


MISTRESS PAGE

That likewise have we thought upon, and thus:
Nan Page my daughter and my little son
And three or four more of their growth we'll dress
Like urchins, ouphes and fairies, green and white,
With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,
And rattles in their hands: upon a sudden,
As Falstaff, she and I, are newly met,
Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once
With some diffused song: upon their sight,
We two in great amazedness will fly:
Then let them all encircle him about
And, fairy-like, to-pinch the unclean knight,
And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,
In their so sacred paths he dares to tread
In shape profane.


MISTRESS FORD

                  And till he tell the truth,
Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound
And burn him with their tapers.


MISTRESS PAGE

The truth being known,
We'll all present ourselves, dis-horn the spirit,
And mock him home to Windsor.


FORD

The children must
Be practised well to this, or they'll ne'er do't.


SIR HUGH EVANS

I will teach the children their behaviors; and I
will be like a jack-an-apes also, to burn the
knight with my taber.


FORD

That will be excellent. I'll go and buy them vizards.


MISTRESS PAGE

My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies,
Finely attired in a robe of white.


PAGE

That silk will I go buy.
Aside
And in that time
Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away
And marry her at Eton. Go send to Falstaff straight.


FORD

Nay I'll to him again in name of Brook
He'll tell me all his purpose: sure, he'll come.


MISTRESS PAGE

Fear not you that. Go get us properties
And tricking for our fairies.


SIR HUGH EVANS

Let us about it: it is admirable pleasures and fery
honest knaveries.
Exeunt PAGE, FORD, and SIR HUGH EVANS


MISTRESS PAGE

Go, Mistress Ford,
Send quickly to Sir John, to know his mind.
Exit MISTRESS FORD
I'll to the doctor: he hath my good will,
And none but he, to marry with Nan Page.
That Slender, though well landed, is an idiot;
And he my husband best of all affects.
The doctor is well money'd, and his friends
Potent at court: he, none but he, shall have her,
Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her.
Exit

SCENE V. A room in the Garter Inn.

Enter Host and SIMPLE


Host

What wouldst thou have, boor? what: thick-skin?
speak, breathe, discuss; brief, short, quick, snap.


SIMPLE

Marry, sir, I come to speak with Sir John Falstaff
from Master Slender.


Host

There's his chamber, his house, his castle, his
standing-bed and truckle-bed; 'tis painted about
with the story of the Prodigal, fresh and new. Go
knock and call; hell speak like an Anthropophaginian
unto thee: knock, I say.


SIMPLE

There's an old woman, a fat woman, gone up into his
chamber: I'll be so bold as stay, sir, till she come
down; I come to speak with her, indeed.


Host

Ha! a fat woman! the knight may be robbed: I'll
call. Bully knight! bully Sir John! speak from
thy lungs military: art thou there? it is thine
host, thine Ephesian, calls.


FALSTAFF

[Above]  How now, mine host!


Host

Here's a Bohemian-Tartar tarries the coming down of
thy fat woman. Let her descend, bully, let her
descend; my chambers are honourable: fie! privacy?
fie!
Enter FALSTAFF


FALSTAFF

There was, mine host, an old fat woman even now with
me;  but she's gone.


SIMPLE

Pray you, sir, was't not the wise woman of
Brentford?


FALSTAFF

Ay, marry, was it, mussel-shell: what would you with her?


SIMPLE

My master, sir, Master Slender, sent to her, seeing
her go through the streets, to know, sir, whether
one Nym, sir, that beguiled him of a chain, had the
chain or no.


FALSTAFF

I spake with the old woman about it.


SIMPLE

And what says she, I pray, sir?


FALSTAFF

Marry, she says that the very same man that
beguiled Master Slender of his chain cozened him of
it.


SIMPLE

I would I could have spoken with the woman herself;
I had other things to have spoken with her too from
him.


FALSTAFF

What are they? let us know.


Host

Ay, come; quick.


SIMPLE

I may not conceal them, sir.


Host

Conceal them, or thou diest.


SIMPLE

Why, sir, they were nothing but about Mistress Anne
Page; to know if it were my master's fortune to
have her or no.


FALSTAFF

'Tis, 'tis his fortune.


SIMPLE

What, sir?


FALSTAFF

To have her, or no. Go; say the woman told me so.


SIMPLE

May I be bold to say so, sir?


FALSTAFF

Ay, sir; like who more bold.


SIMPLE

I thank your worship: I shall make my master glad
with these tidings.
Exit


Host

Thou art clerkly, thou art clerkly, Sir John. Was
there a wise woman with thee?


FALSTAFF

Ay, that there was, mine host; one that hath taught
me more wit than ever I learned before in my life;
and I paid nothing for it neither, but was paid for
my learning.
Enter BARDOLPH


BARDOLPH

Out, alas, sir! cozenage, mere cozenage!


Host

Where be my horses? speak well of them, varletto.


BARDOLPH

Run away with the cozeners; for so soon as I came
beyond Eton, they threw me off from behind one of
them, in a slough of mire; and set spurs and away,
like three German devils, three Doctor Faustuses.


Host

They are gone but to meet the duke, villain: do not
say they be fled; Germans are honest men.
Enter SIR HUGH EVANS


SIR HUGH EVANS

Where is mine host?


Host

What is the matter, sir?


SIR HUGH EVANS

Have a care of your entertainments: there is a
friend of mine come to town tells me there is three
cozen-germans that has cozened all the hosts of
Readins, of Maidenhead, of Colebrook, of horses and
money. I tell you for good will, look you: you
are wise and full of gibes and vlouting-stocks, and
'tis not convenient you should be cozened. Fare you well.
Exit
Enter DOCTOR CAIUS


DOCTOR CAIUS

Vere is mine host de Jarteer?


Host

Here, master doctor, in perplexity and doubtful dilemma.


DOCTOR CAIUS

I cannot tell vat is dat: but it is tell-a me dat
you make grand preparation for a duke de Jamany: by
my trot, dere is no duke dat the court is know to
come. I tell you for good vill: adieu.
Exit


Host

Hue and cry, villain, go! Assist me, knight. I am
undone! Fly, run, hue and cry, villain! I am undone!
Exeunt Host and BARDOLPH


FALSTAFF

I would all the world might be cozened; for I have
been cozened and beaten too. If it should come to
the ear of the court, how I have been transformed
and how my transformation hath been washed and
cudgelled, they would melt me out of my fat drop by
drop and liquor fishermen's boots with me; I warrant
they would whip me with their fine wits till I were
as crest-fallen as a dried pear. I never prospered
since I forswore myself at primero. Well, if my
wind were but long enough to say my prayers, I would repent.
Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY
Now, whence come you?


MISTRESS QUICKLY

From the two parties, forsooth.


FALSTAFF

The devil take one party and his dam the other! and
so they shall be both bestowed. I have suffered more
for their sakes, more than the villanous inconstancy
of man's disposition is able to bear.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

And have not they suffered? Yes, I warrant;
speciously one of them; Mistress Ford, good heart,
is beaten black and blue, that you cannot see a
white spot about her.


FALSTAFF

What tellest thou me of black and blue? I was
beaten myself into all the colours of the rainbow;
and I was like to be apprehended for the witch of
Brentford: but that my admirable dexterity of wit,
my counterfeiting the action of an old woman,
delivered me, the knave constable had set me i' the
stocks, i' the common stocks, for a witch.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Sir, let me speak with you in your chamber: you
shall hear how things go; and, I warrant, to your
content. Here is a letter will say somewhat. Good
hearts, what ado here is to bring you together!
Sure, one of you does not serve heaven well, that
you are so crossed.


FALSTAFF

Come up into my chamber.
Exeunt

SCENE VI. Another room in the Garter Inn.

Enter FENTON and Host


Host

Master Fenton, talk not to me; my mind is heavy: I
will give over all.


FENTON

Yet hear me speak. Assist me in my purpose,
And, as I am a gentleman, I'll give thee
A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.


Host

I will hear you, Master Fenton; and I will at the
least keep your counsel.


FENTON

From time to time I have acquainted you
With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page;
Who mutually hath answer'd my affection,
So far forth as herself might be her chooser,
Even to my wish: I have a letter from her
Of such contents as you will wonder at;
The mirth whereof so larded with my matter,
That neither singly can be manifested,
Without the show of both; fat Falstaff
Hath a great scene: the image of the jest
I'll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host.
To-night at Herne's oak, just 'twixt twelve and one,
Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;
The purpose why, is here: in which disguise,
While other jests are something rank on foot,
Her father hath commanded her to slip
Away with Slender and with him at Eton
Immediately to marry: she hath consented: Now, sir,
Her mother, ever strong against that match
And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed
That he shall likewise shuffle her away,
While other sports are tasking of their minds,
And at the deanery, where a priest attends,
Straight marry her: to this her mother's plot
She seemingly obedient likewise hath
Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:
Her father means she shall be all in white,
And in that habit, when Slender sees his time
To take her by the hand and bid her go,
She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,
The better to denote her to the doctor,
For they must all be mask'd and vizarded,
That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,
With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head;
And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,
To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,
The maid hath given consent to go with him.


Host

Which means she to deceive, father or mother?


FENTON

Both, my good host, to go along with me:
And here it rests, that you'll procure the vicar
To stay for me at church 'twixt twelve and one,
And, in the lawful name of marrying,
To give our hearts united ceremony.


Host

Well, husband your device; I'll to the vicar:
Bring you the maid, you shall not lack a priest.


FENTON

So shall I evermore be bound to thee;
Besides, I'll make a present recompense.
Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. A room in the Garter Inn.

Enter FALSTAFF and MISTRESS QUICKLY


FALSTAFF

Prithee, no more prattling; go. I'll hold. This is
the third time; I hope good luck lies in odd
numbers. Away I go. They say there is divinity in
odd numbers, either in nativity, chance, or death. Away!


MISTRESS QUICKLY

I'll provide you a chain; and I'll do what I can to
get you a pair of horns.


FALSTAFF

Away, I say; time wears: hold up your head, and mince.
Exit MISTRESS QUICKLY
Enter FORD
How now, Master Brook! Master Brook, the matter
will be known to-night, or never. Be you in the
Park about midnight, at Herne's oak, and you shall
see wonders.


FORD

Went you not to her yesterday, sir, as you told me
you had appointed?


FALSTAFF

I went to her, Master Brook, as you see, like a poor
old man: but I came from her, Master Brook, like a
poor old woman. That same knave Ford, her husband,
hath the finest mad devil of jealousy in him,
Master Brook, that ever governed frenzy. I will tell
you: he beat me grievously, in the shape of a
woman; for in the shape of man, Master Brook, I fear
not Goliath with a weaver's beam; because I know
also life is a shuttle. I am in haste; go along
with me: I'll tell you all, Master Brook. Since I
plucked geese, played truant and whipped top, I knew
not what 'twas to be beaten till lately. Follow
me: I'll tell you strange things of this knave
Ford, on whom to-night I will be revenged, and I
will deliver his wife into your hand. Follow.
Strange things in hand, Master Brook! Follow.
Exeunt

SCENE II. Windsor Park.

Enter PAGE, SHALLOW, and SLENDER


PAGE

Come, come; we'll couch i' the castle-ditch till we
see the light of our fairies. Remember, son Slender,
my daughter.


SLENDER

Ay, forsooth; I have spoke with her and we have a
nay-word how to know one another: I come to her in
white, and cry 'mum;' she cries 'budget;' and by
that we know one another.


SHALLOW

That's good too: but what needs either your 'mum'
or her 'budget?' the white will decipher her well
enough. It hath struck ten o'clock.


PAGE

The night is dark; light and spirits will become it
well. Heaven prosper our sport! No man means evil
but the devil, and we shall know him by his horns.
Let's away; follow me.
Exeunt

SCENE III. A street leading to the Park.

Enter MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS FORD, and DOCTOR CAIUS


MISTRESS PAGE

Master doctor, my daughter is in green: when you
see your time, take her by the band, away with her
to the deanery, and dispatch it quickly. Go before
into the Park: we two must go together.


DOCTOR CAIUS

I know vat I have to do. Adieu.


MISTRESS PAGE

Fare you well, sir.
Exit DOCTOR CAIUS
My husband will not rejoice so much at the abuse of
Falstaff as he will chafe at the doctor's marrying
my daughter: but 'tis no matter; better a little
chiding than a great deal of heart-break.


MISTRESS FORD

Where is Nan now and her troop of fairies, and the
Welsh devil Hugh?


MISTRESS PAGE

They are all couched in a pit hard by Herne's oak,
with obscured lights; which, at the very instant of
Falstaff's and our meeting, they will at once
display to the night.


MISTRESS FORD

That cannot choose but amaze him.


MISTRESS PAGE

If he be not amazed, he will be mocked; if he be
amazed, he will every way be mocked.


MISTRESS FORD

We'll betray him finely.


MISTRESS PAGE

Against such lewdsters and their lechery
Those that betray them do no treachery.


MISTRESS FORD

The hour draws on. To the oak, to the oak!
Exeunt

SCENE IV. Windsor Park.

Enter SIR HUGH EVANS, disguised, with others as Fairies


SIR HUGH EVANS

Trib, trib, fairies; come; and remember your parts:
be pold, I pray you; follow me into the pit; and
when I give the watch-'ords, do as I pid you:
come, come; trib, trib.
Exeunt

SCENE V. Another part of the Park.

Enter FALSTAFF disguised as Herne


FALSTAFF

The Windsor bell hath struck twelve; the minute
draws on. Now, the hot-blooded gods assist me!
Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy Europa; love
set on thy horns. O powerful love! that, in some
respects, makes a beast a man, in some other, a man
a beast. You were also, Jupiter, a swan for the love
of Leda. O omnipotent Love! how near the god drew
to the complexion of a goose! A fault done first in
the form of a beast. O Jove, a beastly fault! And
then another fault in the semblance of a fowl; think
on 't, Jove; a foul fault! When gods have hot
backs, what shall poor men do? For me, I am here a
Windsor stag; and the fattest, I think, i' the
forest. Send me a cool rut-time, Jove, or who can
blame me to piss my tallow? Who comes here? my
doe?
Enter MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE


MISTRESS FORD

Sir John! art thou there, my deer? my male deer?


FALSTAFF

My doe with the black scut! Let the sky rain
potatoes; let it thunder to the tune of Green
Sleeves, hail kissing-comfits and snow eringoes; let
there come a tempest of provocation, I will shelter me here.


MISTRESS FORD

Mistress Page is come with me, sweetheart.


FALSTAFF

Divide me like a bribe buck, each a haunch: I will
keep my sides to myself, my shoulders for the fellow
of this walk, and my horns I bequeath your husbands.
Am I a woodman, ha? Speak I like Herne the hunter?
Why, now is Cupid a child of conscience; he makes
restitution. As I am a true spirit, welcome!
Noise within


MISTRESS PAGE

Alas, what noise?


MISTRESS FORD

Heaven forgive our sins


FALSTAFF

What should this be?


MISTRESS FORD

MISTRESS PAGE

Away, away!
They run off


FALSTAFF

I think the devil will not have me damned, lest the
oil that's in me should set hell on fire; he would
never else cross me thus.
Enter SIR HUGH EVANS, disguised as before; PISTOL,  as Hobgoblin; MISTRESS QUICKLY, ANNE PAGE, and others, as Fairies, with tapers


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Fairies, black, grey, green, and white,
You moonshine revellers and shades of night,
You orphan heirs of fixed destiny,
Attend your office and your quality.
Crier Hobgoblin, make the fairy oyes.


PISTOL

Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
Cricket, to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap:
Where fires thou find'st unraked and hearths unswept,
There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry:
Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery.


FALSTAFF

They are fairies; he that speaks to them shall die:
I'll wink and couch: no man their works must eye.
Lies down upon his face


SIR HUGH EVANS

Where's Bede? Go you, and where you find a maid
That, ere she sleep, has thrice her prayers said,
Raise up the organs of her fantasy;
Sleep she as sound as careless infancy:
But those as sleep and think not on their sins,
Pinch them, arms, legs, backs, shoulders, sides and shins.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

About, about;
Search Windsor Castle, elves, within and out:
Strew good luck, ouphes, on every sacred room:
That it may stand till the perpetual doom,
In state as wholesome as in state 'tis fit,
Worthy the owner, and the owner it.
The several chairs of order look you scour
With juice of balm and every precious flower:
Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
With loyal blazon, evermore be blest!
And nightly, meadow-fairies, look you sing,
Like to the Garter's compass, in a ring:
The expressure that it bears, green let it be,
More fertile-fresh than all the field to see;
And 'Honi soit qui mal y pense' write
In emerald tufts, flowers purple, blue and white;
Let sapphire, pearl and rich embroidery,
Buckled below fair knighthood's bending knee:
Fairies use flowers for their charactery.
Away; disperse: but till 'tis one o'clock,
Our dance of custom round about the oak
Of Herne the hunter, let us not forget.


SIR HUGH EVANS

Pray you, lock hand in hand; yourselves in order set
And twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be,
To guide our measure round about the tree.
But, stay; I smell a man of middle-earth.


FALSTAFF

Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy, lest he
transform me to a piece of cheese!


PISTOL

Vile worm, thou wast o'erlook'd even in thy birth.


MISTRESS QUICKLY

With trial-fire touch me his finger-end:
If he be chaste, the flame will back descend
And turn him to no pain; but if he start,
It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.


PISTOL

A trial, come.


SIR HUGH EVANS

Come, will this wood take fire?
They burn him with their tapers


FALSTAFF

Oh, Oh, Oh!


MISTRESS QUICKLY

Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire!
About him, fairies; sing a scornful rhyme;
And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time.
SONG.
Fie on sinful fantasy!
Fie on lust and luxury!
Lust is but a bloody fire,
Kindled with unchaste desire,
Fed in heart, whose flames aspire
As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.
Pinch him, fairies, mutually;
Pinch him for his villany;
Pinch him, and burn him, and turn him about,
Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out.
During this song they pinch FALSTAFF. DOCTOR CAIUS  comes one way, and steals away a boy in green;  SLENDER another way, and takes off a boy in white;  and FENTON comes and steals away ANN PAGE.  A noise of hunting is heard within. All the  Fairies run away. FALSTAFF pulls off his buck's head, and rises
Enter PAGE, FORD, MISTRESS PAGE, and MISTRESS FORD


PAGE

Nay, do not fly; I think we have watch'd you now
Will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn?


MISTRESS PAGE

I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher
Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
See you these, husband? do not these fair yokes
Become the forest better than the town?


FORD

Now, sir, who's a cuckold now? Master Brook,
Falstaff's a knave, a cuckoldly knave; here are his
horns, Master Brook: and, Master Brook, he hath
enjoyed nothing of Ford's but his buck-basket, his
cudgel, and twenty pounds of money, which must be
paid to Master Brook; his horses are arrested for
it, Master Brook.


MISTRESS FORD

Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never meet.
I will never take you for my love again; but I will
always count you my deer.


FALSTAFF

I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.


FORD

Ay, and an ox too: both the proofs are extant.


FALSTAFF

And these are not fairies? I was three or four
times in the thought they were not fairies: and yet
the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my
powers, drove the grossness of the foppery into a
received belief, in despite of the teeth of all
rhyme and reason, that they were fairies. See now
how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent, when 'tis upon
ill employment!


SIR HUGH EVANS

Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your
desires, and fairies will not pinse you.


FORD

Well said, fairy Hugh.


SIR HUGH EVANS

And leave your jealousies too, I pray you.


FORD

I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art
able to woo her in good English.


FALSTAFF

Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it, that
it wants matter to prevent so gross o'erreaching as
this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? shall I
have a coxcomb of frize? 'Tis time I were choked
with a piece of toasted cheese.


SIR HUGH EVANS

Seese is not good to give putter; your belly is all putter.


FALSTAFF

'Seese' and 'putter'! have I lived to stand at the
taunt of one that makes fritters of English? This
is enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking
through the realm.


MISTRESS PAGE

Why Sir John, do you think, though we would have the
virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders
and have given ourselves without scruple to hell,
that ever the devil could have made you our delight?


FORD

What, a hodge-pudding? a bag of flax?


MISTRESS PAGE

A puffed man?


PAGE

Old, cold, withered and of intolerable entrails?


FORD

And one that is as slanderous as Satan?


PAGE

And as poor as Job?


FORD

And as wicked as his wife?


SIR HUGH EVANS

And given to fornications, and to taverns and sack
and wine and metheglins, and to drinkings and
swearings and starings, pribbles and prabbles?


FALSTAFF

Well, I am your theme: you have the start of me; I
am dejected; I am not able to answer the Welsh
flannel; ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me: use
me as you will.


FORD

Marry, sir, we'll bring you to Windsor, to one
Master Brook, that you have cozened of money, to
whom you should have been a pander: over and above
that you have suffered, I think to repay that money
will be a biting affliction.


PAGE

Yet be cheerful, knight: thou shalt eat a posset
to-night at my house; where I will desire thee to
laugh at my wife, that now laughs at thee: tell her
Master Slender hath married her daughter.


MISTRESS PAGE

[Aside]  Doctors doubt that: if Anne Page be my
daughter, she is, by this, Doctor Caius' wife.
Enter SLENDER


SLENDER

Whoa ho! ho, father Page!


PAGE

Son, how now! how now, son! have you dispatched?


SLENDER

Dispatched! I'll make the best in Gloucestershire
know on't; would I were hanged, la, else.


PAGE

Of what, son?


SLENDER

I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page,
and she's a great lubberly boy. If it had not been
i' the church, I would have swinged him, or he
should have swinged me. If I did not think it had
been Anne Page, would I might never stir!--and 'tis
a postmaster's boy.


PAGE

Upon my life, then, you took the wrong.


SLENDER

What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took
a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for
all he was in woman's apparel, I would not have had
him.


PAGE

Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how
you should know my daughter by her garments?


SLENDER

I went to her in white, and cried 'mum,' and she
cried 'budget,' as Anne and I had appointed; and yet
it was not Anne, but a postmaster's boy.


MISTRESS PAGE

Good George, be not angry: I knew of your purpose;
turned my daughter into green; and, indeed, she is
now with the doctor at the deanery, and there married.
Enter DOCTOR CAIUS


DOCTOR CAIUS

Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened: I ha'
married un garcon, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy;
it is not Anne Page: by gar, I am cozened.


MISTRESS PAGE

Why, did you take her in green?


DOCTOR CAIUS

Ay, by gar, and 'tis a boy: by gar, I'll raise all Windsor.
Exit


FORD

This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?


PAGE

My heart misgives me: here comes Master Fenton.
Enter FENTON and ANNE PAGE
How now, Master Fenton!


ANNE PAGE

Pardon, good father! good my mother, pardon!


PAGE

Now, mistress, how chance you went not with Master Slender?


MISTRESS PAGE

Why went you not with master doctor, maid?


FENTON

You do amaze her: hear the truth of it.
You would have married her most shamefully,
Where there was no proportion held in love.
The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,
Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.
The offence is holy that she hath committed;
And this deceit loses the name of craft,
Of disobedience, or unduteous title,
Since therein she doth evitate and shun
A thousand irreligious cursed hours,
Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.


FORD

Stand not amazed; here is no remedy:
In love the heavens themselves do guide the state;
Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.


FALSTAFF

I am glad, though you have ta'en a special stand to
strike at me, that your arrow hath glanced.


PAGE

Well, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee joy!
What cannot be eschew'd must be embraced.


FALSTAFF

When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased.


MISTRESS PAGE

Well, I will muse no further. Master Fenton,
Heaven give you many, many merry days!
Good husband, let us every one go home,
And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire;
Sir John and all.


FORD

                  Let it be so. Sir John,
To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word
For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.
Exeunt




A Midsummer Night's Dream

ACT I
SCENE I. Athens. The palace of THESEUS.

Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, and Attendants


THESEUS

Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow
This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,
Like to a step-dame or a dowager
Long withering out a young man revenue.


HIPPOLYTA

Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
And then the moon, like to a silver bow
New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night
Of our solemnities.


THESEUS

Go, Philostrate,
Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;
Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;
Turn melancholy forth to funerals;
The pale companion is not for our pomp.
Exit PHILOSTRATE
Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,
And won thy love, doing thee injuries;
But I will wed thee in another key,
With pomp, with triumph and with revelling.
Enter EGEUS, HERMIA, LYSANDER, and DEMETRIUS


EGEUS

Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!


THESEUS

Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?


EGEUS

Full of vexation come I, with complaint
Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,
This man hath my consent to marry her.
Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,
This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;
Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
And interchanged love-tokens with my child:
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
With feigning voice verses of feigning love,
And stolen the impression of her fantasy
With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers
Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:
With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,
Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,
To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,
Be it so she; will not here before your grace
Consent to marry with Demetrius,
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,
As she is mine, I may dispose of her:
Which shall be either to this gentleman
Or to her death, according to our law
Immediately provided in that case.


THESEUS

What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:
To you your father should be as a god;
One that composed your beauties, yea, and one
To whom you are but as a form in wax
By him imprinted and within his power
To leave the figure or disfigure it.
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.


HERMIA

So is Lysander.


THESEUS

                  In himself he is;
But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,
The other must be held the worthier.


HERMIA

I would my father look'd but with my eyes.


THESEUS

Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.


HERMIA

I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
I know not by what power I am made bold,
Nor how it may concern my modesty,
In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;
But I beseech your grace that I may know
The worst that may befall me in this case,
If I refuse to wed Demetrius.


THESEUS

Either to die the death or to abjure
For ever the society of men.
Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;
Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,
You can endure the livery of a nun,
For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,
To live a barren sister all your life,
Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,
To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;
But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.


HERMIA

So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
Ere I will my virgin patent up
Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke
My soul consents not to give sovereignty.


THESEUS

Take time to pause; and, by the nest new moon--
The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,
For everlasting bond of fellowship--
Upon that day either prepare to die
For disobedience to your father's will,
Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;
Or on Diana's altar to protest
For aye austerity and single life.


DEMETRIUS

Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield
Thy crazed title to my certain right.


LYSANDER

You have her father's love, Demetrius;
Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.


EGEUS

Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,
And what is mine my love shall render him.
And she is mine, and all my right of her
I do estate unto Demetrius.


LYSANDER

I am, my lord, as well derived as he,
As well possess'd; my love is more than his;
My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,
If not with vantage, as Demetrius';
And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:
Why should not I then prosecute my right?
Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,
Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,
And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
Upon this spotted and inconstant man.


THESEUS

I must confess that I have heard so much,
And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
But, being over-full of self-affairs,
My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;
And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,
I have some private schooling for you both.
For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself
To fit your fancies to your father's will;
Or else the law of Athens yields you up--
Which by no means we may extenuate--
To death, or to a vow of single life.
Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?
Demetrius and Egeus, go along:
I must employ you in some business
Against our nuptial and confer with you
Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.


EGEUS

With duty and desire we follow you.
Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA


LYSANDER

How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?
How chance the roses there do fade so fast?


HERMIA

Belike for want of rain, which I could well
Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.


LYSANDER

Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,
Could ever hear by tale or history,
The course of true love never did run smooth;
But, either it was different in blood,--


HERMIA

O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.


LYSANDER

Or else misgraffed in respect of years,--


HERMIA

O spite! too old to be engaged to young.


LYSANDER

Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--


HERMIA

O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.


LYSANDER

Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,
Making it momentany as a sound,
Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;
Brief as the lightning in the collied night,
That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,
And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'
The jaws of darkness do devour it up:
So quick bright things come to confusion.


HERMIA

If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,
It stands as an edict in destiny:
Then let us teach our trial patience,
Because it is a customary cross,
As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.


LYSANDER

A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia.
I have a widow aunt, a dowager
Of great revenue, and she hath no child:
From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;
And she respects me as her only son.
There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;
And to that place the sharp Athenian law
Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,
Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;
And in the wood, a league without the town,
Where I did meet thee once with Helena,
To do observance to a morn of May,
There will I stay for thee.


HERMIA

My good Lysander!
I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,
By his best arrow with the golden head,
By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,
When the false Troyan under sail was seen,
By all the vows that ever men have broke,
In number more than ever women spoke,
In that same place thou hast appointed me,
To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.


LYSANDER

Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.
Enter HELENA


HERMIA

God speed fair Helena! whither away?


HELENA

Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.
Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!
Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air
More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,
When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,
Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;
My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,
My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.
Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
The rest I'd give to be to you translated.
O, teach me how you look, and with what art
You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.


HERMIA

I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.


HELENA

O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!


HERMIA

I give him curses, yet he gives me love.


HELENA

O that my prayers could such affection move!


HERMIA

The more I hate, the more he follows me.


HELENA

The more I love, the more he hateth me.


HERMIA

His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.


HELENA

None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!


HERMIA

Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;
Lysander and myself will fly this place.
Before the time I did Lysander see,
Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:
O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!


LYSANDER

Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:
To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
Her silver visage in the watery glass,
Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.


HERMIA

And in the wood, where often you and I
Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,
Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,
There my Lysander and myself shall meet;
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,
To seek new friends and stranger companies.
Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;
And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!
Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight
From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.


LYSANDER

I will, my Hermia.
Exit HERMIA
Helena, adieu:
As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!
Exit


HELENA

How happy some o'er other some can be!
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
He will not know what all but he do know:
And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,
So I, admiring of his qualities:
Things base and vile, folding no quantity,
Love can transpose to form and dignity:
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:
Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
And therefore is Love said to be a child,
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
So the boy Love is perjured every where:
For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,
He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,
So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.
I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:
Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
Pursue her; and for this intelligence
If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:
But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
To have his sight thither and back again.
Exit

SCENE II. Athens. QUINCE'S house.

Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING


QUINCE

Is all our company here?


BOTTOM

You were best to call them generally, man by man,
according to the scrip.


QUINCE

Here is the scroll of every man's name, which is
thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our
interlude before the duke and the duchess, on his
wedding-day at night.


BOTTOM

First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats
on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow
to a point.


QUINCE

Marry, our play is, The most lamentable comedy, and
most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.


BOTTOM

A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a
merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your
actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.


QUINCE

Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.


BOTTOM

Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.


QUINCE

You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.


BOTTOM

What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?


QUINCE

A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.


BOTTOM

That will ask some tears in the true performing of
it: if I do it, let the audience look to their
eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some
measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a
tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to
tear a cat in, to make all split.
The raging rocks
And shivering shocks
Shall break the locks
Of prison gates;
And Phibbus' car
Shall shine from far
And make and mar
The foolish Fates.
This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players.
This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is
more condoling.


QUINCE

Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.


FLUTE

Here, Peter Quince.


QUINCE

Flute, you must take Thisby on you.


FLUTE

What is Thisby? a wandering knight?


QUINCE

It is the lady that Pyramus must love.


FLUTE

Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard coming.


QUINCE

That's all one: you shall play it in a mask, and
you may speak as small as you will.


BOTTOM

An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too, I'll
speak in a monstrous little voice. 'Thisne,
Thisne;' 'Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby dear,
and lady dear!'


QUINCE

No, no; you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you Thisby.


BOTTOM

Well, proceed.


QUINCE

Robin Starveling, the tailor.


STARVELING

Here, Peter Quince.


QUINCE

Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.
Tom Snout, the tinker.


SNOUT

Here, Peter Quince.


QUINCE

You, Pyramus' father: myself, Thisby's father:
Snug, the joiner; you, the lion's part: and, I
hope, here is a play fitted.


SNUG

Have you the lion's part written? pray you, if it
be, give it me, for I am slow of study.


QUINCE

You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.


BOTTOM

Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I will
do any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar,
that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again,
let him roar again.'


QUINCE

An you should do it too terribly, you would fright
the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek;
and that were enough to hang us all.


ALL

That would hang us, every mother's son.


BOTTOM

I grant you, friends, if that you should fright the
ladies out of their wits, they would have no more
discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my
voice so that I will roar you as gently as any
sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any
nightingale.


QUINCE

You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a
sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a
summer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man:
therefore you must needs play Pyramus.


BOTTOM

Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best
to play it in?


QUINCE

Why, what you will.


BOTTOM

I will discharge it in either your straw-colour
beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain
beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your
perfect yellow.


QUINCE

Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and
then you will play bare-faced. But, masters, here
are your parts: and I am to entreat you, request
you and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night;
and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the
town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if
we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with
company, and our devices known. In the meantime I
will draw a bill of properties, such as our play
wants. I pray you, fail me not.


BOTTOM

We will meet; and there we may rehearse most
obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect: adieu.


QUINCE

At the duke's oak we meet.


BOTTOM

Enough; hold or cut bow-strings.
Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. A wood near Athens.

Enter, from opposite sides, a Fairy, and PUCK


PUCK

How now, spirit! whither wander you?


Fairy

     Over hill, over dale,
Thorough bush, thorough brier,
Over park, over pale,
Thorough flood, thorough fire,
I do wander everywhere,
Swifter than the moon's sphere;
And I serve the fairy queen,
To dew her orbs upon the green.
The cowslips tall her pensioners be:
In their gold coats spots you see;
Those be rubies, fairy favours,
In those freckles live their savours:
I must go seek some dewdrops here
And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:
Our queen and all our elves come here anon.


PUCK

The king doth keep his revels here to-night:
Take heed the queen come not within his sight;
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
Because that she as her attendant hath
A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;
She never had so sweet a changeling;
And jealous Oberon would have the child
Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:
And now they never meet in grove or green,
By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
But, they do square, that all their elves for fear
Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.


Fairy

Either I mistake your shape and making quite,
Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he
That frights the maidens of the villagery;
Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern
And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;
And sometime make the drink to bear no barm;
Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?
Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,
You do their work, and they shall have good luck:
Are not you he?


PUCK

                  Thou speak'st aright;
I am that merry wanderer of the night.
I jest to Oberon and make him smile
When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,
Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:
And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,
In very likeness of a roasted crab,
And when she drinks, against her lips I bob
And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.
The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,
Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;
Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,
And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;
And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,
And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear
A merrier hour was never wasted there.
But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon.


Fairy

And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!
Enter, from one side, OBERON, with his train; from the other, TITANIA, with hers


OBERON

Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.


TITANIA

What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence:
I have forsworn his bed and company.


OBERON

Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?


TITANIA

Then I must be thy lady: but I know
When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,
And in the shape of Corin sat all day,
Playing on pipes of corn and versing love
To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,
Come from the farthest Steppe of India?
But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,
Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,
To Theseus must be wedded, and you come
To give their bed joy and prosperity.


OBERON

How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,
Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,
Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night
From Perigenia, whom he ravished?
And make him with fair AEgle break his faith,
With Ariadne and Antiopa?


TITANIA

These are the forgeries of jealousy:
And never, since the middle summer's spring,
Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,
By paved fountain or by rushy brook,
Or in the beached margent of the sea,
To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,
But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.
Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,
As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea
Contagious fogs; which falling in the land
Have every pelting river made so proud
That they have overborne their continents:
The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,
The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn
Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;
The fold stands empty in the drowned field,
And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;
The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,
And the quaint mazes in the wanton green
For lack of tread are undistinguishable:
The human mortals want their winter here;
No night is now with hymn or carol blest:
Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
Pale in her anger, washes all the air,
That rheumatic diseases do abound:
And thorough this distemperature we see
The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts
Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,
And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown
An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,
The childing autumn, angry winter, change
Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,
By their increase, now knows not which is which:
And this same progeny of evils comes
From our debate, from our dissension;
We are their parents and original.


OBERON

Do you amend it then; it lies in you:
Why should Titania cross her Oberon?
I do but beg a little changeling boy,
To be my henchman.


TITANIA

                  Set your heart at rest:
The fairy land buys not the child of me.
His mother was a votaress of my order:
And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,
Full often hath she gossip'd by my side,
And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,
Marking the embarked traders on the flood,
When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive
And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;
Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait
Following,--her womb then rich with my young squire,--
Would imitate, and sail upon the land,
To fetch me trifles, and return again,
As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.
But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;
And for her sake do I rear up her boy,
And for her sake I will not part with him.


OBERON

How long within this wood intend you stay?


TITANIA

Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.
If you will patiently dance in our round
And see our moonlight revels, go with us;
If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.


OBERON

Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.


TITANIA

Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!
We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.
Exit TITANIA with her train


OBERON

Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove
Till I torment thee for this injury.
My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest
Since once I sat upon a promontory,
And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back
Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
That the rude sea grew civil at her song
And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,
To hear the sea-maid's music.


PUCK

I remember.


OBERON

That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,
Flying between the cold moon and the earth,
Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took
At a fair vestal throned by the west,
And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,
As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;
But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft
Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon,
And the imperial votaress passed on,
In maiden meditation, fancy-free.
Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:
It fell upon a little western flower,
Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,
And maidens call it love-in-idleness.
Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee once:
The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid
Will make or man or woman madly dote
Upon the next live creature that it sees.
Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again
Ere the leviathan can swim a league.


PUCK

I'll put a girdle round about the earth
In forty minutes.
Exit


OBERON

                  Having once this juice,
I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,
And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.
The next thing then she waking looks upon,
Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,
On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,
She shall pursue it with the soul of love:
And ere I take this charm from off her sight,
As I can take it with another herb,
I'll make her render up her page to me.
But who comes here? I am invisible;
And I will overhear their conference.
Enter DEMETRIUS, HELENA, following him


DEMETRIUS

I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?
The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.
Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood;
And here am I, and wode within this wood,
Because I cannot meet my Hermia.
Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.


HELENA

You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;
But yet you draw not iron, for my heart
Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw,
And I shall have no power to follow you.


DEMETRIUS

Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?
Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth
Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you?


HELENA

And even for that do I love you the more.
I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,
The more you beat me, I will fawn on you:
Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,
Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,
Unworthy as I am, to follow you.
What worser place can I beg in your love,--
And yet a place of high respect with me,--
Than to be used as you use your dog?


DEMETRIUS

Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;
For I am sick when I do look on thee.


HELENA

And I am sick when I look not on you.


DEMETRIUS

You do impeach your modesty too much,
To leave the city and commit yourself
Into the hands of one that loves you not;
To trust the opportunity of night
And the ill counsel of a desert place
With the rich worth of your virginity.


HELENA

Your virtue is my privilege: for that
It is not night when I do see your face,
Therefore I think I am not in the night;
Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,
For you in my respect are all the world:
Then how can it be said I am alone,
When all the world is here to look on me?


DEMETRIUS

I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,
And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.


HELENA

The wildest hath not such a heart as you.
Run when you will, the story shall be changed:
Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;
The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind
Makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed,
When cowardice pursues and valour flies.


DEMETRIUS

I will not stay thy questions; let me go:
Or, if thou follow me, do not believe
But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.


HELENA

Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,
You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!
Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:
We cannot fight for love, as men may do;
We should be wood and were not made to woo.
Exit DEMETRIUS
I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell,
To die upon the hand I love so well.
Exit


OBERON

Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,
Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.
Re-enter PUCK
Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.


PUCK

Ay, there it is.


OBERON

I pray thee, give it me.
I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,
Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,
Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,
With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,
Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight;
And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,
Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in:
And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,
And make her full of hateful fantasies.
Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:
A sweet Athenian lady is in love
With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;
But do it when the next thing he espies
May be the lady: thou shalt know the man
By the Athenian garments he hath on.
Effect it with some care, that he may prove
More fond on her than she upon her love:
And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.


PUCK

Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so.
Exeunt

SCENE II. Another part of the wood.

Enter TITANIA, with her train


TITANIA

Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;
Then, for the third part of a minute, hence;
Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,
Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,
To make my small elves coats, and some keep back
The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;
Then to your offices and let me rest.
The Fairies sing
You spotted snakes with double tongue,
Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;
Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong,
Come not near our fairy queen.
Philomel, with melody
Sing in our sweet lullaby;
Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby:
Never harm,
Nor spell nor charm,
Come our lovely lady nigh;
So, good night, with lullaby.
Weaving spiders, come not here;
Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence!
Beetles black, approach not near;
Worm nor snail, do no offence.
Philomel, with melody,  & c.


Fairy

Hence, away! now all is well:
One aloof stand sentinel.
Exeunt Fairies. TITANIA sleeps
Enter OBERON and squeezes the flower on TITANIA's eyelids


OBERON

What thou seest when thou dost wake,
Do it for thy true-love take,
Love and languish for his sake:
Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,
Pard, or boar with bristled hair,
In thy eye that shall appear
When thou wakest, it is thy dear:
Wake when some vile thing is near.
Exit
Enter LYSANDER and HERMIA


LYSANDER

Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood;
And to speak troth, I have forgot our way:
We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,
And tarry for the comfort of the day.


HERMIA

Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed;
For I upon this bank will rest my head.


LYSANDER

One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;
One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.


HERMIA

Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,
Lie further off yet, do not lie so near.


LYSANDER

O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!
Love takes the meaning in love's conference.
I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit
So that but one heart we can make of it;
Two bosoms interchained with an oath;
So then two bosoms and a single troth.
Then by your side no bed-room me deny;
For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.


HERMIA

Lysander riddles very prettily:
Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,
If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.
But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy
Lie further off; in human modesty,
Such separation as may well be said
Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,
So far be distant; and, good night, sweet friend:
Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!


LYSANDER

Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;
And then end life when I end loyalty!
Here is my bed: sleep give thee all his rest!


HERMIA

With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd!
They sleep
Enter PUCK


PUCK

Through the forest have I gone.
But Athenian found I none,
On whose eyes I might approve
This flower's force in stirring love.
Night and silence.--Who is here?
Weeds of Athens he doth wear:
This is he, my master said,
Despised the Athenian maid;
And here the maiden, sleeping sound,
On the dank and dirty ground.
Pretty soul! she durst not lie
Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.
Churl, upon thy eyes I throw
All the power this charm doth owe.
When thou wakest, let love forbid
Sleep his seat on thy eyelid:
So awake when I am gone;
For I must now to Oberon.
Exit
Enter DEMETRIUS and HELENA, running


HELENA

Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.


DEMETRIUS

I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.


HELENA

O, wilt thou darkling leave me? do not so.


DEMETRIUS

Stay, on thy peril: I alone will go.
Exit


HELENA

O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!
The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.
Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies;
For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.
How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:
If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers.
No, no, I am as ugly as a bear;
For beasts that meet me run away for fear:
Therefore no marvel though Demetrius
Do, as a monster fly my presence thus.
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine
Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?
But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!
Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.
Lysander if you live, good sir, awake.


LYSANDER

[Awaking]  And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.
Transparent Helena! Nature shows art,
That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.
Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word
Is that vile name to perish on my sword!


HELENA

Do not say so, Lysander; say not so
What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?
Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.


LYSANDER

Content with Hermia! No; I do repent
The tedious minutes I with her have spent.
Not Hermia but Helena I love:
Who will not change a raven for a dove?
The will of man is by his reason sway'd;
And reason says you are the worthier maid.
Things growing are not ripe until their season
So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;
And touching now the point of human skill,
Reason becomes the marshal to my will
And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook
Love's stories written in love's richest book.


HELENA

Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?
When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?
Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man,
That I did never, no, nor never can,
Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye,
But you must flout my insufficiency?
Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,
In such disdainful manner me to woo.
But fare you well: perforce I must confess
I thought you lord of more true gentleness.
O, that a lady, of one man refused.
Should of another therefore be abused!
Exit


LYSANDER

She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleep thou there:
And never mayst thou come Lysander near!
For as a surfeit of the sweetest things
The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,
Or as tie heresies that men do leave
Are hated most of those they did deceive,
So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,
Of all be hated, but the most of me!
And, all my powers, address your love and might
To honour Helen and to be her knight!
Exit


HERMIA

[Awaking]  Help me, Lysander, help me! do thy best
To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast!
Ay me, for pity! what a dream was here!
Lysander, look how I do quake with fear:
Methought a serpent eat my heart away,
And you sat smiling at his cruel pray.
Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord!
What, out of hearing? gone? no sound, no word?
Alack, where are you speak, an if you hear;
Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.
No? then I well perceive you all not nigh
Either death or you I'll find immediately.
Exit

ACT III
SCENE I. The wood. TITANIA lying asleep.

Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING


BOTTOM

Are we all met?


QUINCE

Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place
for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our
stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we
will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.


BOTTOM

Peter Quince,--


QUINCE

What sayest thou, bully Bottom?


BOTTOM

There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and
Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must
draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies
cannot abide. How answer you that?


SNOUT

By'r lakin, a parlous fear.


STARVELING

I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.


BOTTOM

Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.
Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to
say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that
Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more
better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not
Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them
out of fear.


QUINCE

Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be
written in eight and six.


BOTTOM

No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.


SNOUT

Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?


STARVELING

I fear it, I promise you.


BOTTOM

Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to
bring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies, is a
most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful
wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to
look to 't.


SNOUT

Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.


BOTTOM

Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must
be seen through the lion's neck: and he himself
must speak through, saying thus, or to the same
defect,--'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wish
You,'--or 'I would request you,'--or 'I would
entreat you,--not to fear, not to tremble: my life
for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it
were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a
man as other men are;' and there indeed let him name
his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.


QUINCE

Well it shall be so. But there is two hard things;
that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for,
you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.


SNOUT

Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?


BOTTOM

A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac; find
out moonshine, find out moonshine.


QUINCE

Yes, it doth shine that night.


BOTTOM

Why, then may you leave a casement of the great
chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon
may shine in at the casement.


QUINCE

Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns
and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to
present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is
another thing: we must have a wall in the great
chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did
talk through the chink of a wall.


SNOUT

You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?


BOTTOM

Some man or other must present Wall: and let him
have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast
about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his
fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus
and Thisby whisper.


QUINCE

If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit  down,
every mother's son, and rehearse your parts.
Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your
speech, enter into that brake: and so every one
according to his cue.
Enter PUCK behind


PUCK

What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here,
So near the cradle of the fairy queen?
What, a play toward! I'll be an auditor;
An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause.


QUINCE

Speak, Pyramus. Thisby, stand forth.


BOTTOM

Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet,--


QUINCE

Odours, odours.


BOTTOM

--odours savours sweet:
So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear.
But hark, a voice! stay thou but here awhile,
And by and by I will to thee appear.
Exit


PUCK

A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here.
Exit


FLUTE

Must I speak now?


QUINCE

Ay, marry, must you; for you must understand he goes
but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.


FLUTE

Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,
Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,
Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew,
As true as truest horse that yet would never tire,
I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.


QUINCE

'Ninus' tomb,' man: why, you must not speak that
yet; that you answer to Pyramus: you speak all your
part at once, cues and all Pyramus enter: your cue
is past; it is, 'never tire.'


FLUTE

O,--As true as truest horse, that yet would
never tire.
Re-enter PUCK, and BOTTOM with an ass's head


BOTTOM

If I were fair, Thisby, I were only thine.


QUINCE

O monstrous! O strange! we are haunted. Pray,
masters! fly, masters! Help!
Exeunt QUINCE, SNUG, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING


PUCK

I'll follow you, I'll lead you about a round,
Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier:
Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound,
A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;
And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,
Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.
Exit


BOTTOM

Why do they run away? this is a knavery of them to
make me afeard.
Re-enter SNOUT


SNOUT

O Bottom, thou art changed! what do I see on thee?


BOTTOM

What do you see? you see an asshead of your own, do
you?
Exit SNOUT
Re-enter QUINCE


QUINCE

Bless thee, Bottom! bless thee! thou art
translated.
Exit


BOTTOM

I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me;
to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir
from this place, do what they can: I will walk up
and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear
I am not afraid.
Sings
The ousel cock so black of hue,
With orange-tawny bill,
The throstle with his note so true,
The wren with little quill,--


TITANIA

[Awaking]  What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?


BOTTOM

[Sings]
The finch, the sparrow and the lark,
The plain-song cuckoo gray,
Whose note full many a man doth mark,
And dares not answer nay;--
for, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish
a bird? who would give a bird the lie, though he cry
'cuckoo' never so?


TITANIA

I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again:
Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;
So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;
And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me
On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee.


BOTTOM

Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason
for that: and yet, to say the truth, reason and
love keep little company together now-a-days; the
more the pity that some honest neighbours will not
make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.


TITANIA

Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.


BOTTOM

Not so, neither: but if I had wit enough to get out
of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.


TITANIA

Out of this wood do not desire to go:
Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.
I am a spirit of no common rate;
The summer still doth tend upon my state;
And I do love thee: therefore, go with me;
I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee,
And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,
And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep;
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.
Peaseblossom! Cobweb! Moth! and Mustardseed!
Enter PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH, and MUSTARDSEED


PEASEBLOSSOM

Ready.


COBWEB

     And I.


MOTH

          And I.


MUSTARDSEED

                  And I.


ALL

Where shall we go?


TITANIA

Be kind and courteous to this gentleman;
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;
Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,
With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;
The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,
And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs
And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,
To have my love to bed and to arise;
And pluck the wings from Painted butterflies
To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes:
Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.


PEASEBLOSSOM

Hail, mortal!


COBWEB

Hail!


MOTH

Hail!


MUSTARDSEED

Hail!


BOTTOM

I cry your worship's mercy, heartily: I beseech your
worship's name.


COBWEB

Cobweb.


BOTTOM

I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master
Cobweb: if I cut my finger, I shall make bold with
you. Your name, honest gentleman?


PEASEBLOSSOM

Peaseblossom.


BOTTOM

I pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash, your
mother, and to Master Peascod, your father. Good
Master Peaseblossom, I shall desire you of more
acquaintance too. Your name, I beseech you, sir?


MUSTARDSEED

Mustardseed.


BOTTOM

Good Master Mustardseed, I know your patience well:
that same cowardly, giant-like ox-beef hath
devoured many a gentleman of your house: I promise
you your kindred had made my eyes water ere now. I
desire your more acquaintance, good Master
Mustardseed.


TITANIA

Come, wait upon him; lead him to my bower.
The moon methinks looks with a watery eye;
And when she weeps, weeps every little flower,
Lamenting some enforced chastity.
Tie up my love's tongue bring him silently.
Exeunt

SCENE II. Another part of the wood.

Enter OBERON


OBERON

I wonder if Titania be awaked;
Then, what it was that next came in her eye,
Which she must dote on in extremity.
Enter PUCK
Here comes my messenger.
How now, mad spirit!
What night-rule now about this haunted grove?


PUCK

My mistress with a monster is in love.
Near to her close and consecrated bower,
While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,
A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,
Were met together to rehearse a play
Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.
The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,
Who Pyramus presented, in their sport
Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake
When I did him at this advantage take,
An ass's nole I fixed on his head:
Anon his Thisbe must be answered,
And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,
As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,
Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,
So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;
And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls;
He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears
thus strong,
Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;
For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;
Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all
things catch.
I led them on in this distracted fear,
And left sweet Pyramus translated there:
When in that moment, so it came to pass,
Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.


OBERON

This falls out better than I could devise.
But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes
With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?


PUCK

I took him sleeping,--that is finish'd too,--
And the Athenian woman by his side:
That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.
Enter HERMIA and DEMETRIUS


OBERON

Stand close: this is the same Athenian.


PUCK

This is the woman, but not this the man.


DEMETRIUS

O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?
Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.


HERMIA

Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse,
For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse,
If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,
Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,
And kill me too.
The sun was not so true unto the day
As he to me: would he have stolen away
From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon
This whole earth may be bored and that the moon
May through the centre creep and so displease
Her brother's noontide with Antipodes.
It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him;
So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.


DEMETRIUS

So should the murder'd look, and so should I,
Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty:
Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,
As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.


HERMIA

What's this to my Lysander? where is he?
Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?


DEMETRIUS

I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.


HERMIA

Out, dog! out, cur! thou drivest me past the bounds
Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?
Henceforth be never number'd among men!
O, once tell true, tell true, even for my sake!
Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake,
And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch!
Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?
An adder did it; for with doubler tongue
Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.


DEMETRIUS

You spend your passion on a misprised mood:
I am not guilty of Lysander's blood;
Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.


HERMIA

I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.


DEMETRIUS

An if I could, what should I get therefore?


HERMIA

A privilege never to see me more.
And from thy hated presence part I so:
See me no more, whether he be dead or no.
Exit


DEMETRIUS

There is no following her in this fierce vein:
Here therefore for a while I will remain.
So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow
For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe:
Which now in some slight measure it will pay,
If for his tender here I make some stay.
Lies down and sleeps


OBERON

What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite
And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight:
Of thy misprision must perforce ensue
Some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true.


PUCK

Then fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding troth,
A million fail, confounding oath on oath.


OBERON

About the wood go swifter than the wind,
And Helena of Athens look thou find:
All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,
With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear:
By some illusion see thou bring her here:
I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.


PUCK

I go, I go; look how I go,
Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.
Exit


OBERON

   Flower of this purple dye,
Hit with Cupid's archery,
Sink in apple of his eye.
When his love he doth espy,
Let her shine as gloriously
As the Venus of the sky.
When thou wakest, if she be by,
Beg of her for remedy.
Re-enter PUCK


PUCK

   Captain of our fairy band,
Helena is here at hand;
And the youth, mistook by me,
Pleading for a lover's fee.
Shall we their fond pageant see?
Lord, what fools these mortals be!


OBERON

Stand aside: the noise they make
Will cause Demetrius to awake.


PUCK

Then will two at once woo one;
That must needs be sport alone;
And those things do best please me
That befal preposterously.
Enter LYSANDER and HELENA


LYSANDER

Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?
Scorn and derision never come in tears:
Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,
In their nativity all truth appears.
How can these things in me seem scorn to you,
Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?


HELENA

You do advance your cunning more and more.
When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!
These vows are Hermia's: will you give her o'er?
Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh:
Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,
Will even weigh, and both as light as tales.


LYSANDER

I had no judgment when to her I swore.


HELENA

Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.


LYSANDER

Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.


DEMETRIUS

[Awaking]  O Helena, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!
To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?
Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show
Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!
That pure congealed white, high Taurus snow,
Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow
When thou hold'st up thy hand: O, let me kiss
This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!


HELENA

O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent
To set against me for your merriment:
If you we re civil and knew courtesy,
You would not do me thus much injury.
Can you not hate me, as I know you do,
But you must join in souls to mock me too?
If you were men, as men you are in show,
You would not use a gentle lady so;
To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,
When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.
You both are rivals, and love Hermia;
And now both rivals, to mock Helena:
A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes
With your derision! none of noble sort
Would so offend a virgin, and extort
A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.


LYSANDER

You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;
For you love Hermia; this you know I know:
And here, with all good will, with all my heart,
In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;
And yours of Helena to me bequeath,
Whom I do love and will do till my death.


HELENA

Never did mockers waste more idle breath.


DEMETRIUS

Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none:
If e'er I loved her, all that love is gone.
My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd,
And now to Helen is it home return'd,
There to remain.


LYSANDER

                  Helen, it is not so.


DEMETRIUS

Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,
Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear.
Look, where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.
Re-enter HERMIA


HERMIA

Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,
The ear more quick of apprehension makes;
Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,
It pays the hearing double recompense.
Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;
Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound
But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?


LYSANDER

Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go?


HERMIA

What love could press Lysander from my side?


LYSANDER

Lysander's love, that would not let him bide,
Fair Helena, who more engilds the night
Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light.
Why seek'st thou me? could not this make thee know,
The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?


HERMIA

You speak not as you think: it cannot be.


HELENA

Lo, she is one of this confederacy!
Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three
To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.
Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!
Have you conspired, have you with these contrived
To bait me with this foul derision?
Is all the counsel that we two have shared,
The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,
When we have chid the hasty-footed time
For parting us,--O, is it all forgot?
All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?
We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,
Have with our needles created both one flower,
Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,
Both warbling of one song, both in one key,
As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds,
Had been incorporate. So we grow together,
Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,
But yet an union in partition;
Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;
So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;
Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,
Due but to one and crowned with one crest.
And will you rent our ancient love asunder,
To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:
Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,
Though I alone do feel the injury.


HERMIA

I am amazed at your passionate words.
I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn me.


HELENA

Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,
To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
And made your other love, Demetrius,
Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,
To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,
Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this
To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander
Deny your love, so rich within his soul,
And tender me, forsooth, affection,
But by your setting on, by your consent?
What thought I be not so in grace as you,
So hung upon with love, so fortunate,
But miserable most, to love unloved?
This you should pity rather than despise.


HERNIA

I understand not what you mean by this.


HELENA

Ay, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks,
Make mouths upon me when I turn my back;
Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up:
This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.
If you have any pity, grace, or manners,
You would not make me such an argument.
But fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault;
Which death or absence soon shall remedy.


LYSANDER

Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:
My love, my life my soul, fair Helena!


HELENA

O excellent!


HERMIA

                  Sweet, do not scorn her so.


DEMETRIUS

If she cannot entreat, I can compel.


LYSANDER

Thou canst compel no more than she entreat:
Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.
Helen, I love thee; by my life, I do:
I swear by that which I will lose for thee,
To prove him false that says I love thee not.


DEMETRIUS

I say I love thee more than he can do.


LYSANDER

If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.


DEMETRIUS

Quick, come!


HERMIA

Lysander, whereto tends all this?


LYSANDER

Away, you Ethiope!


DEMETRIUS

                  No, no; he'll [        ]
Seem to break loose; take on as you would follow,
But yet come not: you are a tame man, go!


LYSANDER

Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent!


HERMIA

Why are you grown so rude? what change is this?
Sweet love,--


LYSANDER

Thy love! out, tawny Tartar, out!
Out, loathed medicine! hated potion, hence!


HERMIA

Do you not jest?


HELENA

Yes, sooth; and so do you.


LYSANDER

Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.


DEMETRIUS

I would I had your bond, for I perceive
A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.


LYSANDER

What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?
Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.


HERMIA

What, can you do me greater harm than hate?
Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love!
Am not I Hermia? are not you Lysander?
I am as fair now as I was erewhile.
Since night you loved me; yet since night you left
me:
Why, then you left me--O, the gods forbid!--
In earnest, shall I say?


LYSANDER

Ay, by my life;
And never did desire to see thee more.
Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;
Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest
That I do hate thee and love Helena.


HERMIA

O me! you juggler! you canker-blossom!
You thief of love! what, have you come by night
And stolen my love's heart from him?


HELENA

Fine, i'faith!
Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,
No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear
Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet, you!


HERMIA

Puppet? why so? ay, that way goes the game.
Now I perceive that she hath made compare
Between our statures; she hath urged her height;
And with her personage, her tall personage,
Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him.
And are you grown so high in his esteem;
Because I am so dwarfish and so low?
How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak;
How low am I? I am not yet so low
But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.


HELENA

I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,
Let her not hurt me: I was never curst;
I have no gift at all in shrewishness;
I am a right maid for my cowardice:
Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,
Because she is something lower than myself,
That I can match her.


HERMIA

Lower! hark, again.


HELENA

Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.
I evermore did love you, Hermia,
Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you;
Save that, in love unto Demetrius,
I told him of your stealth unto this wood.
He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him;
But he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me
To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:
And now, so you will let me quiet go,
To Athens will I bear my folly back
And follow you no further: let me go:
You see how simple and how fond I am.


HERMIA

Why, get you gone: who is't that hinders you?


HELENA

A foolish heart, that I leave here behind.


HERMIA

What, with Lysander?


HELENA

With Demetrius.


LYSANDER

Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena.


DEMETRIUS

No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.


HELENA

O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!
She was a vixen when she went to school;
And though she be but little, she is fierce.


HERMIA

'Little' again! nothing but 'low' and 'little'!
Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
Let me come to her.


LYSANDER

Get you gone, you dwarf;
You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made;
You bead, you acorn.


DEMETRIUS

You are too officious
In her behalf that scorns your services.
Let her alone: speak not of Helena;
Take not her part; for, if thou dost intend
Never so little show of love to her,
Thou shalt aby it.


LYSANDER

                  Now she holds me not;
Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right,
Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.


DEMETRIUS

Follow! nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jole.
Exeunt LYSANDER and DEMETRIUS


HERMIA

You, mistress, all this coil is 'long of you:
Nay, go not back.


HELENA

                  I will not trust you, I,
Nor longer stay in your curst company.
Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray,
My legs are longer though, to run away.
Exit


HERMIA

I am amazed, and know not what to say.
Exit


OBERON

This is thy negligence: still thou mistakest,
Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully.


PUCK

Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.
Did not you tell me I should know the man
By the Athenian garment be had on?
And so far blameless proves my enterprise,
That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes;
And so far am I glad it so did sort
As this their jangling I esteem a sport.


OBERON

Thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight:
Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;
The starry welkin cover thou anon
With drooping fog as black as Acheron,
And lead these testy rivals so astray
As one come not within another's way.
Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,
Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;
And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;
And from each other look thou lead them thus,
Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep
With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep:
Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye;
Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,
To take from thence all error with his might,
And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.
When they next wake, all this derision
Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision,
And back to Athens shall the lovers wend,
With league whose date till death shall never end.
Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,
I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy;
And then I will her charmed eye release
From monster's view, and all things shall be peace.


PUCK

My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,
For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,
And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger;
At whose approach, ghosts, wandering here and there,
Troop home to churchyards: damned spirits all,
That in crossways and floods have burial,
Already to their wormy beds are gone;
For fear lest day should look their shames upon,
They willfully themselves exile from light
And must for aye consort with black-brow'd night.


OBERON

But we are spirits of another sort:
I with the morning's love have oft made sport,
And, like a forester, the groves may tread,
Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,
Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.
But, notwithstanding, haste; make no delay:
We may effect this business yet ere day.
Exit


PUCK

   Up and down, up and down,
I will lead them up and down:
I am fear'd in field and town:
Goblin, lead them up and down.
Here comes one.
Re-enter LYSANDER


LYSANDER

Where art thou, proud Demetrius? speak thou now.


PUCK

Here, villain; drawn and ready. Where art thou?


LYSANDER

I will be with thee straight.


PUCK

Follow me, then,
To plainer ground.
Exit LYSANDER, as following the voice
Re-enter DEMETRIUS


DEMETRIUS

                  Lysander! speak again:
Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?
Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?


PUCK

Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,
Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,
And wilt not come? Come, recreant; come, thou child;
I'll whip thee with a rod: he is defiled
That draws a sword on thee.


DEMETRIUS

Yea, art thou there?


PUCK

Follow my voice: we'll try no manhood here.
Exeunt
Re-enter LYSANDER


LYSANDER

He goes before me and still dares me on:
When I come where he calls, then he is gone.
The villain is much lighter-heel'd than I:
I follow'd fast, but faster he did fly;
That fallen am I in dark uneven way,
And here will rest me.
Lies down
Come, thou gentle day!
For if but once thou show me thy grey light,
I'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite.
Sleeps
Re-enter PUCK and DEMETRIUS


PUCK

Ho, ho, ho! Coward, why comest thou not?


DEMETRIUS

Abide me, if thou darest; for well I wot
Thou runn'st before me, shifting every place,
And darest not stand, nor look me in the face.
Where art thou now?


PUCK

Come hither: I am here.


DEMETRIUS

Nay, then, thou mock'st me. Thou shalt buy this dear,
If ever I thy face by daylight see:
Now, go thy way. Faintness constraineth me
To measure out my length on this cold bed.
By day's approach look to be visited.
Lies down and sleeps
Re-enter HELENA


HELENA

O weary night, O long and tedious night,
Abate thy hour! Shine comforts from the east,
That I may back to Athens by daylight,
From these that my poor company detest:
And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye,
Steal me awhile from mine own company.
Lies down and sleeps


PUCK

Yet but three? Come one more;
Two of both kinds make up four.
Here she comes, curst and sad:
Cupid is a knavish lad,
Thus to make poor females mad.
Re-enter HERMIA


HERMIA

Never so weary, never so in woe,
Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers,
I can no further crawl, no further go;
My legs can keep no pace with my desires.
Here will I rest me till the break of day.
Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray!
Lies down and sleeps


PUCK

                  On the ground
Sleep sound:
I'll apply
To your eye,
Gentle lover, remedy.
Squeezing the juice on LYSANDER's eyes
When thou wakest,
Thou takest
True delight
In the sight
Of thy former lady's eye:
And the country proverb known,
That every man should take his own,
In your waking shall be shown:
Jack shall have Jill;
Nought shall go ill;
The man shall have his mare again, and all shall be well.

ACT IV
SCENE I. The same. LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and HERMIA

lying asleep.
Enter TITANIA and BOTTOM; PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH,  MUSTARDSEED, and other Fairies attending; OBERON behind unseen


TITANIA

Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed,
While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,
And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,
And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.


BOTTOM

Where's Peaseblossom?


PEASEBLOSSOM

Ready.


BOTTOM

Scratch my head Peaseblossom. Where's Mounsieur Cobweb?


COBWEB

Ready.


BOTTOM

Mounsieur Cobweb, good mounsieur, get you your
weapons in your hand, and kill me a red-hipped
humble-bee on the top of a thistle; and, good
mounsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret
yourself too much in the action, mounsieur; and,
good mounsieur, have a care the honey-bag break not;
I would be loath to have you overflown with a
honey-bag, signior. Where's Mounsieur Mustardseed?


MUSTARDSEED

Ready.


BOTTOM

Give me your neaf, Mounsieur Mustardseed. Pray you,
leave your courtesy, good mounsieur.


MUSTARDSEED

What's your Will?


BOTTOM

Nothing, good mounsieur, but to help Cavalery Cobweb
to scratch. I must to the barber's, monsieur; for
methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face; and I
am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me,
I must scratch.


TITANIA

What, wilt thou hear some music,
my sweet love?


BOTTOM

I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let's have
the tongs and the bones.


TITANIA

Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.


BOTTOM

Truly, a peck of provender: I could munch your good
dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle
of hay: good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.


TITANIA

I have a venturous fairy that shall seek
The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new nuts.


BOTTOM

I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas.
But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me: I
have an exposition of sleep come upon me.


TITANIA

Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.
Fairies, begone, and be all ways away.
Exeunt fairies
So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle
Gently entwist; the female ivy so
Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
O, how I love thee! how I dote on thee!
They sleep
Enter PUCK


OBERON

[Advancing]  Welcome, good Robin.
See'st thou this sweet sight?
Her dotage now I do begin to pity:
For, meeting her of late behind the wood,
Seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool,
I did upbraid her and fall out with her;
For she his hairy temples then had rounded
With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;
And that same dew, which sometime on the buds
Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,
Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes
Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
When I had at my pleasure taunted her
And she in mild terms begg'd my patience,
I then did ask of her her changeling child;
Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent
To bear him to my bower in fairy land.
And now I have the boy, I will undo
This hateful imperfection of her eyes:
And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp
From off the head of this Athenian swain;
That, he awaking when the other do,
May all to Athens back again repair
And think no more of this night's accidents
But as the fierce vexation of a dream.
But first I will release the fairy queen.
Be as thou wast wont to be;
See as thou wast wont to see:
Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower
Hath such force and blessed power.
Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen.


TITANIA

My Oberon! what visions have I seen!
Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.


OBERON

There lies your love.


TITANIA

How came these things to pass?
O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!


OBERON

Silence awhile. Robin, take off this head.
Titania, music call; and strike more dead
Than common sleep of all these five the sense.


TITANIA

Music, ho! music, such as charmeth sleep!
Music, still


PUCK

Now, when thou wakest, with thine
own fool's eyes peep.


OBERON

Sound, music! Come, my queen, take hands with me,
And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.
Now thou and I are new in amity,
And will to-morrow midnight solemnly
Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly,
And bless it to all fair prosperity:
There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.


PUCK

Fairy king, attend, and mark:
I do hear the morning lark.


OBERON

Then, my queen, in silence sad,
Trip we after the night's shade:
We the globe can compass soon,
Swifter than the wandering moon.


TITANIA

Come, my lord, and in our flight
Tell me how it came this night
That I sleeping here was found
With these mortals on the ground.
Exeunt
Horns winded within
Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train


THESEUS

Go, one of you, find out the forester;
For now our observation is perform'd;
And since we have the vaward of the day,
My love shall hear the music of my hounds.
Uncouple in the western valley; let them go:
Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.
Exit an Attendant
We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top,
And mark the musical confusion
Of hounds and echo in conjunction.


HIPPOLYTA

I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,
When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear
With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear
Such gallant chiding: for, besides the groves,
The skies, the fountains, every region near
Seem'd all one mutual cry: I never heard
So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.


THESEUS

My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,
So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung
With ears that sweep away the morning dew;
Crook-knee'd, and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls;
Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,
Each under each. A cry more tuneable
Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn,
In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly:
Judge when you hear. But, soft! what nymphs are these?


EGEUS

My lord, this is my daughter here asleep;
And this, Lysander; this Demetrius is;
This Helena, old Nedar's Helena:
I wonder of their being here together.


THESEUS

No doubt they rose up early to observe
The rite of May, and hearing our intent,
Came here in grace our solemnity.
But speak, Egeus; is not this the day
That Hermia should give answer of her choice?


EGEUS

It is, my lord.


THESEUS

Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.
Horns and shout within. LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and HERMIA wake and start up
Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past:
Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?


LYSANDER

Pardon, my lord.


THESEUS

                  I pray you all, stand up.
I know you two are rival enemies:
How comes this gentle concord in the world,
That hatred is so far from jealousy,
To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?


LYSANDER

My lord, I shall reply amazedly,
Half sleep, half waking: but as yet, I swear,
I cannot truly say how I came here;
But, as I think,--for truly would I speak,
And now do I bethink me, so it is,--
I came with Hermia hither: our intent
Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,
Without the peril of the Athenian law.


EGEUS

Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
I beg the law, the law, upon his head.
They would have stolen away; they would, Demetrius,
Thereby to have defeated you and me,
You of your wife and me of my consent,
Of my consent that she should be your wife.


DEMETRIUS

My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,
Of this their purpose hither to this wood;
And I in fury hither follow'd them,
Fair Helena in fancy following me.
But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,--
But by some power it is,--my love to Hermia,
Melted as the snow, seems to me now
As the remembrance of an idle gaud
Which in my childhood I did dote upon;
And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
The object and the pleasure of mine eye,
Is only Helena. To her, my lord,
Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:
But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food;
But, as in health, come to my natural taste,
Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,
And will for evermore be true to it.


THESEUS

Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:
Of this discourse we more will hear anon.
Egeus, I will overbear your will;
For in the temple by and by with us
These couples shall eternally be knit:
And, for the morning now is something worn,
Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.
Away with us to Athens; three and three,
We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.
Come, Hippolyta.
Exeunt THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train


DEMETRIUS

These things seem small and undistinguishable,


HERMIA

Methinks I see these things with parted eye,
When every thing seems double.


HELENA

So methinks:
And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,
Mine own, and not mine own.


DEMETRIUS

Are you sure
That we are awake? It seems to me
That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think
The duke was here, and bid us follow him?


HERMIA

Yea; and my father.


HELENA

And Hippolyta.


LYSANDER

And he did bid us follow to the temple.


DEMETRIUS

Why, then, we are awake: let's follow him
And by the way let us recount our dreams.
Exeunt


BOTTOM

[Awaking]  When my cue comes, call me, and I will
answer: my next is, 'Most fair Pyramus.' Heigh-ho!
Peter Quince! Flute, the bellows-mender! Snout,
the tinker! Starveling! God's my life, stolen
hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare
vision. I have had a dream, past the wit of man to
say what dream it was: man is but an ass, if he go
about to expound this dream. Methought I was--there
is no man can tell what. Methought I was,--and
methought I had,--but man is but a patched fool, if
he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye
of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not
seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue
to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream
was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of
this dream: it shall be called Bottom's Dream,
because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the
latter end of a play, before the duke:
peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall
sing it at her death.
Exit

SCENE II. Athens. QUINCE'S house.

Enter QUINCE, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING


QUINCE

Have you sent to Bottom's house ? is he come home yet?


STARVELING

He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is
transported.


FLUTE

If he come not, then the play is marred: it goes
not forward, doth it?


QUINCE

It is not possible: you have not a man in all
Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.


FLUTE

No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft
man in Athens.


QUINCE

Yea and the best person too; and he is a very
paramour for a sweet voice.


FLUTE

You must say 'paragon:' a paramour is, God bless us,
a thing of naught.
Enter SNUG


SNUG

Masters, the duke is coming from the temple, and
there is two or three lords and ladies more married:
if our sport had gone forward, we had all been made
men.


FLUTE

O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a
day during his life; he could not have 'scaped
sixpence a day: an the duke had not given him
sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll be hanged;
he would have deserved it: sixpence a day in
Pyramus, or nothing.
Enter BOTTOM


BOTTOM

Where are these lads? where are these hearts?


QUINCE

Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!


BOTTOM

Masters, I am to discourse wonders: but ask me not
what; for if I tell you, I am no true Athenian. I
will tell you every thing, right as it fell out.


QUINCE

Let us hear, sweet Bottom.


BOTTOM

Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that
the duke hath dined. Get your apparel together,
good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your
pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look
o'er his part; for the short and the long is, our
play is preferred. In any case, let Thisby have
clean linen; and let not him that plays the lion
pair his nails, for they shall hang out for the
lion's claws. And, most dear actors, eat no onions
nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath; and I
do not doubt but to hear them say, it is a sweet
comedy. No more words: away! go, away!
Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. Athens. The palace of THESEUS.

Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, Lords and Attendants


HIPPOLYTA

'Tis strange my Theseus, that these
lovers speak of.


THESEUS

More strange than true: I never may believe
These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.
Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend
More than cool reason ever comprehends.
The lunatic, the lover and the poet
Are of imagination all compact:
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,
That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,
Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:
The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling,
Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;
And as imagination bodies forth
The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
A local habitation and a name.
Such tricks hath strong imagination,
That if it would but apprehend some joy,
It comprehends some bringer of that joy;
Or in the night, imagining some fear,
How easy is a bush supposed a bear!


HIPPOLYTA

But all the story of the night told over,
And all their minds transfigured so together,
More witnesseth than fancy's images
And grows to something of great constancy;
But, howsoever, strange and admirable.


THESEUS

Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.
Enter LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HERMIA, and HELENA
Joy, gentle friends! joy and fresh days of love
Accompany your hearts!


LYSANDER

More than to us
Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!


THESEUS

Come now; what masques, what dances shall we have,
To wear away this long age of three hours
Between our after-supper and bed-time?
Where is our usual manager of mirth?
What revels are in hand? Is there no play,
To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?
Call Philostrate.


PHILOSTRATE

                  Here, mighty Theseus.


THESEUS

Say, what abridgement have you for this evening?
What masque? what music? How shall we beguile
The lazy time, if not with some delight?


PHILOSTRATE

There is a brief how many sports are ripe:
Make choice of which your highness will see first.
Giving a paper


THESEUS

[Reads]  'The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung
By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.'
We'll none of that: that have I told my love,
In glory of my kinsman Hercules.
Reads
'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,
Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.'
That is an old device; and it was play'd
When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.
Reads
'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death
Of Learning, late deceased in beggary.'
That is some satire, keen and critical,
Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.
Reads
'A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus
And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.'
Merry and tragical! tedious and brief!
That is, hot ice and wondrous strange snow.
How shall we find the concord of this discord?


PHILOSTRATE

A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,
Which is as brief as I have known a play;
But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,
Which makes it tedious; for in all the play
There is not one word apt, one player fitted:
And tragical, my noble lord, it is;
For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.
Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess,
Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears
The passion of loud laughter never shed.


THESEUS

What are they that do play it?


PHILOSTRATE

Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,
Which never labour'd in their minds till now,
And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories
With this same play, against your nuptial.


THESEUS

And we will hear it.


PHILOSTRATE

No, my noble lord;
It is not for you: I have heard it over,
And it is nothing, nothing in the world;
Unless you can find sport in their intents,
Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
To do you service.


THESEUS

                  I will hear that play;
For never anything can be amiss,
When simpleness and duty tender it.
Go, bring them in: and take your places, ladies.
Exit PHILOSTRATE


HIPPOLYTA

I love not to see wretchedness o'er charged
And duty in his service perishing.


THESEUS

Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.


HIPPOLYTA

He says they can do nothing in this kind.


THESEUS

The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.
Our sport shall be to take what they mistake:
And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect
Takes it in might, not merit.
Where I have come, great clerks have purposed
To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
Make periods in the midst of sentences,
Throttle their practised accent in their fears
And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,
Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;
And in the modesty of fearful duty
I read as much as from the rattling tongue
Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity
In least speak most, to my capacity.
Re-enter PHILOSTRATE


PHILOSTRATE

So please your grace, the Prologue is address'd.


THESEUS

Let him approach.
Flourish of trumpets
Enter QUINCE for the Prologue


Prologue

If we offend, it is with our good will.
That you should think, we come not to offend,
But with good will. To show our simple skill,
That is the true beginning of our end.
Consider then we come but in despite.
We do not come as minding to contest you,
Our true intent is. All for your delight
We are not here. That you should here repent you,
The actors are at hand and by their show
You shall know all that you are like to know.


THESEUS

This fellow doth not stand upon points.


LYSANDER

He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows
not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not
enough to speak, but to speak true.


HIPPOLYTA

Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child
on a recorder; a sound, but not in government.


THESEUS

His speech, was like a tangled chain; nothing
impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?
Enter Pyramus and Thisbe, Wall, Moonshine, and Lion


Prologue

Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
This man is Pyramus, if you would know;
This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content
To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,
The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
Did scare away, or rather did affright;
And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,
Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain:
Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast;
And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain
At large discourse, while here they do remain.
Exeunt Prologue, Thisbe, Lion, and Moonshine


THESEUS

I wonder if the lion be to speak.


DEMETRIUS

No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.


Wall

In this same interlude it doth befall
That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;
And such a wall, as I would have you think,
That had in it a crannied hole or chink,
Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,
Did whisper often very secretly.
This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show
That I am that same wall; the truth is so:
And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.


THESEUS

Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?


DEMETRIUS

It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard
discourse, my lord.
Enter Pyramus


THESEUS

Pyramus draws near the wall: silence!


Pyramus

O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!
O night, which ever art when day is not!
O night, O night! alack, alack, alack,
I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!
And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,
That stand'st between her father's ground and mine!
Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,
Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne!
Wall holds up his fingers
Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!
But what see I? No Thisby do I see.
O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!
Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!


THESEUS

The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.


Pyramus

No, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me'
is Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to
spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will
fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.
Enter Thisbe


Thisbe

O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,
For parting my fair Pyramus and me!
My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones,
Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.


Pyramus

I see a voice: now will I to the chink,
To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face. Thisby!


Thisbe

My love thou art, my love I think.


Pyramus

Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;
And, like Limander, am I trusty still.


Thisbe

And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.


Pyramus

Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.


Thisbe

As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.


Pyramus

O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!


Thisbe

I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.


Pyramus

Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?


Thisbe

'Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay.
Exeunt Pyramus and Thisbe


Wall

Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;
And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.
Exit


THESEUS

Now is the mural down between the two neighbours.


DEMETRIUS

No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear
without warning.


HIPPOLYTA

This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.


THESEUS

The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst
are no worse, if imagination amend them.


HIPPOLYTA

It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.


THESEUS

If we imagine no worse of them than they of
themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here
come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.
Enter Lion and Moonshine


Lion

You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear
The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,
May now perchance both quake and tremble here,
When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.
Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am
A lion-fell, nor else no lion's dam;
For, if I should as lion come in strife
Into this place, 'twere pity on my life.


THESEUS

A very gentle beast, of a good conscience.


DEMETRIUS

The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.


LYSANDER

This lion is a very fox for his valour.


THESEUS

True; and a goose for his discretion.


DEMETRIUS

Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his
discretion; and the fox carries the goose.


THESEUS

His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour;
for the goose carries not the fox. It is well:
leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.


Moonshine

This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;--


DEMETRIUS

He should have worn the horns on his head.


THESEUS

He is no crescent, and his horns are
invisible within the circumference.


Moonshine

This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;
Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be.


THESEUS

This is the greatest error of all the rest: the man
should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else the
man i' the moon?


DEMETRIUS

He dares not come there for the candle; for, you
see, it is already in snuff.


HIPPOLYTA

I am aweary of this moon: would he would change!


THESEUS

It appears, by his small light of discretion, that
he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all
reason, we must stay the time.


LYSANDER

Proceed, Moon.


Moonshine

All that I have to say, is, to tell you that the
lanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this
thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog.


DEMETRIUS

Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all
these are in the moon. But, silence! here comes Thisbe.
Enter Thisbe


Thisbe

This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?


Lion

[Roaring]  Oh--
Thisbe runs off


DEMETRIUS

Well roared, Lion.


THESEUS

Well run, Thisbe.


HIPPOLYTA

Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a
good grace.
The Lion shakes Thisbe's mantle, and exit


THESEUS

Well moused, Lion.


LYSANDER

And so the lion vanished.


DEMETRIUS

And then came Pyramus.
Enter Pyramus


Pyramus

Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;
I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;
For, by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,
I trust to take of truest Thisby sight.
But stay, O spite!
But mark, poor knight,
What dreadful dole is here!
Eyes, do you see?
How can it be?
O dainty duck! O dear!
Thy mantle good,
What, stain'd with blood!
Approach, ye Furies fell!
O Fates, come, come,
Cut thread and thrum;
Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!


THESEUS

This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would
go near to make a man look sad.


HIPPOLYTA

Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.


Pyramus

O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?
Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear:
Which is--no, no--which was the fairest dame
That lived, that loved, that liked, that look'd
with cheer.
Come, tears, confound;
Out, sword, and wound
The pap of Pyramus;
Ay, that left pap,
Where heart doth hop:
Stabs himself
Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.
Now am I dead,
Now am I fled;
My soul is in the sky:
Tongue, lose thy light;
Moon take thy flight:
Exit Moonshine
Now die, die, die, die, die.
Dies


DEMETRIUS

No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.


LYSANDER

Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing.


THESEUS

With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover, and
prove an ass.


HIPPOLYTA

How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes
back and finds her lover?


THESEUS

She will find him by starlight. Here she comes; and
her passion ends the play.
Re-enter Thisbe


HIPPOLYTA

Methinks she should not use a long one for such a
Pyramus: I hope she will be brief.


DEMETRIUS

A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which
Thisbe, is the better; he for a man, God warrant us;
she for a woman, God bless us.


LYSANDER

She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.


DEMETRIUS

And thus she means, videlicet:--


Thisbe

          Asleep, my love?
What, dead, my dove?
O Pyramus, arise!
Speak, speak. Quite dumb?
Dead, dead? A tomb
Must cover thy sweet eyes.
These My lips,
This cherry nose,
These yellow cowslip cheeks,
Are gone, are gone:
Lovers, make moan:
His eyes were green as leeks.
O Sisters Three,
Come, come to me,
With hands as pale as milk;
Lay them in gore,
Since you have shore
With shears his thread of silk.
Tongue, not a word:
Come, trusty sword;
Come, blade, my breast imbrue:
Stabs herself
And, farewell, friends;
Thus Thisby ends:
Adieu, adieu, adieu.
Dies


THESEUS

Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.


DEMETRIUS

Ay, and Wall too.


BOTTOM

[Starting up]  No assure you; the wall is down that
parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the
epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between two
of our company?


THESEUS

No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no
excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all
dead, there needs none to be blamed. Marry, if he
that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself
in Thisbe's garter, it would have been a fine
tragedy: and so it is, truly; and very notably
discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your
epilogue alone.
A dance
The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve:
Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.
I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn
As much as we this night have overwatch'd.
This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled
The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.
A fortnight hold we this solemnity,
In nightly revels and new jollity.
Exeunt
Enter PUCK


PUCK

     Now the hungry lion roars,
And the wolf behowls the moon;
Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,
All with weary task fordone.
Now the wasted brands do glow,
Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,
Puts the wretch that lies in woe
In remembrance of a shroud.
Now it is the time of night
That the graves all gaping wide,
Every one lets forth his sprite,
In the church-way paths to glide:
And we fairies, that do run
By the triple Hecate's team,
From the presence of the sun,
Following darkness like a dream,
Now are frolic: not a mouse
Shall disturb this hallow'd house:
I am sent with broom before,
To sweep the dust behind the door.
Enter OBERON and TITANIA with their train


OBERON

     Through the house give gathering light,
By the dead and drowsy fire:
Every elf and fairy sprite
Hop as light as bird from brier;
And this ditty, after me,
Sing, and dance it trippingly.


TITANIA

First, rehearse your song by rote
To each word a warbling note:
Hand in hand, with fairy grace,
Will we sing, and bless this place.
Song and dance


OBERON

Now, until the break of day,
Through this house each fairy stray.
To the best bride-bed will we,
Which by us shall blessed be;
And the issue there create
Ever shall be fortunate.
So shall all the couples three
Ever true in loving be;
And the blots of Nature's hand
Shall not in their issue stand;
Never mole, hare lip, nor scar,
Nor mark prodigious, such as are
Despised in nativity,
Shall upon their children be.
With this field-dew consecrate,
Every fairy take his gait;
And each several chamber bless,
Through this palace, with sweet peace;
And the owner of it blest
Ever shall in safety rest.
Trip away; make no stay;
Meet me all by break of day.
Exeunt OBERON, TITANIA, and train


PUCK

If we shadows have offended,
Think but this, and all is mended,
That you have but slumber'd here
While these visions did appear.
And this weak and idle theme,
No more yielding but a dream,
Gentles, do not reprehend:
if you pardon, we will mend:
And, as I am an honest Puck,
If we have unearned luck
Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,
We will make amends ere long;
Else the Puck a liar call;
So, good night unto you all.
Give me your hands, if we be friends,
And Robin shall restore amends.
Much Ado About Nothing

ACT I
SCENE I. Before LEONATO'S house.

Enter LEONATO, HERO, and BEATRICE, with a Messenger


LEONATO

I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon
comes this night to Messina.


Messenger

He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off
when I left him.


LEONATO

How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?


Messenger

But few of any sort, and none of name.


LEONATO

A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings
home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath
bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.


Messenger

Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by
Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the
promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,
the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better
bettered expectation than you must expect of me to
tell you how.


LEONATO

He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much
glad of it.


Messenger

I have already delivered him letters, and there
appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could
not show itself modest enough without a badge of
bitterness.


LEONATO

Did he break out into tears?


Messenger

In great measure.


LEONATO

A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces
truer than those that are so washed. How much
better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!


BEATRICE

I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the
wars or no?


Messenger

I know none of that name, lady: there was none such
in the army of any sort.


LEONATO

What is he that you ask for, niece?


HERO

My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.


Messenger

O, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.


BEATRICE

He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged
Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, reading
the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged
him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he
killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath
he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.


LEONATO

Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;
but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.


Messenger

He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.


BEATRICE

You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:
he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an
excellent stomach.


Messenger

And a good soldier too, lady.


BEATRICE

And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?


Messenger

A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all
honourable virtues.


BEATRICE

It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:
but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal.


LEONATO

You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a
kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:
they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit
between them.


BEATRICE

Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last
conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and
now is the whole man governed with one: so that if
he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him
bear it for a difference between himself and his
horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,
to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his
companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.


Messenger

Is't possible?


BEATRICE

Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as
the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the
next block.


Messenger

I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.


BEATRICE

No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray
you, who is his companion? Is there no young
squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?


Messenger

He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.


BEATRICE

O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he
is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker
runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if
he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a
thousand pound ere a' be cured.


Messenger

I will hold friends with you, lady.


BEATRICE

Do, good friend.


LEONATO

You will never run mad, niece.


BEATRICE

No, not till a hot January.


Messenger

Don Pedro is approached.
Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and BALTHASAR


DON PEDRO

Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your
trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid
cost, and you encounter it.


LEONATO

Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of
your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should
remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides
and happiness takes his leave.


DON PEDRO

You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this
is your daughter.


LEONATO

Her mother hath many times told me so.


BENEDICK

Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?


LEONATO

Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.


DON PEDRO

You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this
what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers
herself. Be happy, lady; for you are like an
honourable father.


BENEDICK

If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not
have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as
like him as she is.


BEATRICE

I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior
Benedick: nobody marks you.


BENEDICK

What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?


BEATRICE

Is it possible disdain should die while she hath
such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?
Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come
in her presence.


BENEDICK

Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I
am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I
would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard
heart; for, truly, I love none.


BEATRICE

A dear happiness to women: they would else have
been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God
and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I
had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man
swear he loves me.


BENEDICK

God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some
gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate
scratched face.


BEATRICE

Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such
a face as yours were.


BENEDICK

Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.


BEATRICE

A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.


BENEDICK

I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and
so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's
name; I have done.


BEATRICE

You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.


DON PEDRO

That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio
and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath
invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at
the least a month; and he heartily prays some
occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no
hypocrite, but prays from his heart.


LEONATO

If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.
To DON JOHN
Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to
the prince your brother, I owe you all duty.


DON JOHN

I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank
you.


LEONATO

Please it your grace lead on?


DON PEDRO

Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.
Exeunt all except BENEDICK and CLAUDIO


CLAUDIO

Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?


BENEDICK

I noted her not; but I looked on her.


CLAUDIO

Is she not a modest young lady?


BENEDICK

Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for
my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak
after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?


CLAUDIO

No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.


BENEDICK

Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high
praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little
for a great praise: only this commendation I can
afford her, that were she other than she is, she
were unhandsome; and being no other but as she is, I
do not like her.


CLAUDIO

Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me
truly how thou likest her.


BENEDICK

Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?


CLAUDIO

Can the world buy such a jewel?


BENEDICK

Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this
with a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack,
to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a
rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take
you, to go in the song?


CLAUDIO

In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I
looked on.


BENEDICK

I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such
matter: there's her cousin, an she were not
possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty
as the first of May doth the last of December. But I
hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?


CLAUDIO

I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the
contrary, if Hero would be my wife.


BENEDICK

Is't come to this? In faith, hath not the world
one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?
Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again?
Go to, i' faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck
into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away
Sundays. Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you.
Re-enter DON PEDRO


DON PEDRO

What secret hath held you here, that you followed
not to Leonato's?


BENEDICK

I would your grace would constrain me to tell.


DON PEDRO

I charge thee on thy allegiance.


BENEDICK

You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb
man; I would have you think so; but, on my
allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance. He is
in love. With who? now that is your grace's part.
Mark how short his answer is;--With Hero, Leonato's
short daughter.


CLAUDIO

If this were so, so were it uttered.


BENEDICK

Like the old tale, my lord: 'it is not so, nor
'twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should be
so.'


CLAUDIO

If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it
should be otherwise.


DON PEDRO

Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.


CLAUDIO

You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.


DON PEDRO

By my troth, I speak my thought.


CLAUDIO

And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.


BENEDICK

And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.


CLAUDIO

That I love her, I feel.


DON PEDRO

That she is worthy, I know.


BENEDICK

That I neither feel how she should be loved nor
know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that
fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.


DON PEDRO

Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite
of beauty.


CLAUDIO

And never could maintain his part but in the force
of his will.


BENEDICK

That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she
brought me up, I likewise give her most humble
thanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in my
forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick,
all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do
them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the
right to trust none; and the fine is, for the which
I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.


DON PEDRO

I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.


BENEDICK

With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord,
not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood
with love than I will get again with drinking, pick
out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang me
up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of
blind Cupid.


DON PEDRO

Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou
wilt prove a notable argument.


BENEDICK

If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot
at me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped on
the shoulder, and called Adam.


DON PEDRO

Well, as time shall try: 'In time the savage bull
doth bear the yoke.'


BENEDICK

The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible
Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull's horns and set
them in my forehead: and let me be vilely painted,
and in such great letters as they write 'Here is
good horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign
'Here you may see Benedick the married man.'


CLAUDIO

If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.


DON PEDRO

Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in
Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.


BENEDICK

I look for an earthquake too, then.


DON PEDRO

Well, you temporize with the hours. In the
meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to
Leonato's: commend me to him and tell him I will
not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made
great preparation.


BENEDICK

I have almost matter enough in me for such an
embassage; and so I commit you--


CLAUDIO

To the tuition of God: From my house, if I had it,--


DON PEDRO

The sixth of July: Your loving friend, Benedick.


BENEDICK

Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your
discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and
the guards are but slightly basted on neither: ere
you flout old ends any further, examine your
conscience: and so I leave you.
Exit


CLAUDIO

My liege, your highness now may do me good.


DON PEDRO

My love is thine to teach: teach it but how,
And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
Any hard lesson that may do thee good.


CLAUDIO

Hath Leonato any son, my lord?


DON PEDRO

No child but Hero; she's his only heir.
Dost thou affect her, Claudio?


CLAUDIO

O, my lord,
When you went onward on this ended action,
I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye,
That liked, but had a rougher task in hand
Than to drive liking to the name of love:
But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts
Have left their places vacant, in their rooms
Come thronging soft and delicate desires,
All prompting me how fair young Hero is,
Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.


DON PEDRO

Thou wilt be like a lover presently
And tire the hearer with a book of words.
If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,
And I will break with her and with her father,
And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this end
That thou began'st to twist so fine a story?


CLAUDIO

How sweetly you do minister to love,
That know love's grief by his complexion!
But lest my liking might too sudden seem,
I would have salved it with a longer treatise.


DON PEDRO

What need the bridge much broader than the flood?
The fairest grant is the necessity.
Look, what will serve is fit: 'tis once, thou lovest,
And I will fit thee with the remedy.
I know we shall have revelling to-night:
I will assume thy part in some disguise
And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,
And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart
And take her hearing prisoner with the force
And strong encounter of my amorous tale:
Then after to her father will I break;
And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.
In practise let us put it presently.
Exeunt

SCENE II. A room in LEONATO's house.

Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, meeting


LEONATO

How now, brother! Where is my cousin, your son?
hath he provided this music?


ANTONIO

He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell
you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.


LEONATO

Are they good?


ANTONIO

As the event stamps them: but they have a good
cover; they show well outward. The prince and Count
Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine
orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine:
the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my
niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it
this night in a dance: and if he found her
accordant, he meant to take the present time by the
top and instantly break with you of it.


LEONATO

Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?


ANTONIO

A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and
question him yourself.


LEONATO

No, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appear
itself: but I will acquaint my daughter withal,
that she may be the better prepared for an answer,
if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.
Enter Attendants
Cousins, you know what you have to do. O, I cry you
mercy, friend; go you with me, and I will use your
skill. Good cousin, have a care this busy time.
Exeunt

SCENE III. The same.

Enter DON JOHN and CONRADE


CONRADE

What the good-year, my lord! why are you thus out
of measure sad?


DON JOHN

There is no measure in the occasion that breeds;
therefore the sadness is without limit.


CONRADE

You should hear reason.


DON JOHN

And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it?


CONRADE

If not a present remedy, at least a patient
sufferance.


DON JOHN

I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayest thou art,
born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral
medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide
what I am: I must be sad when I have cause and smile
at no man's jests, eat when I have stomach and wait
for no man's leisure, sleep when I am drowsy and
tend on no man's business, laugh when I am merry and
claw no man in his humour.


CONRADE

Yea, but you must not make the full show of this
till you may do it without controlment. You have of
late stood out against your brother, and he hath
ta'en you newly into his grace; where it is
impossible you should take true root but by the
fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful
that you frame the season for your own harvest.


DON JOHN

I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in
his grace, and it better fits my blood to be
disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob
love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to
be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied
but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with
a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I
have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my
mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do
my liking: in the meantime let me be that I am and
seek not to alter me.


CONRADE

Can you make no use of your discontent?


DON JOHN

I make all use of it, for I use it only.
Who comes here?
Enter BORACHIO
What news, Borachio?


BORACHIO

I came yonder from a great supper: the prince your
brother is royally entertained by Leonato: and I
can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.


DON JOHN

Will it serve for any model to build mischief on?
What is he for a fool that betroths himself to
unquietness?


BORACHIO

Marry, it is your brother's right hand.


DON JOHN

Who? the most exquisite Claudio?


BORACHIO

Even he.


DON JOHN

A proper squire! And who, and who? which way looks
he?


BORACHIO

Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.


DON JOHN

A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?


BORACHIO

Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a
musty room, comes me the prince and Claudio, hand
in hand in sad conference: I whipt me behind the
arras; and there heard it agreed upon that the
prince should woo Hero for himself, and having
obtained her, give her to Count Claudio.


DON JOHN

Come, come, let us thither: this may prove food to
my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the
glory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way, I
bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?


CONRADE

To the death, my lord.


DON JOHN

Let us to the great supper: their cheer is the
greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were of
my mind! Shall we go prove what's to be done?


BORACHIO

We'll wait upon your lordship.
Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. A hall in LEONATO'S house.

Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, HERO, BEATRICE, and others


LEONATO

Was not Count John here at supper?


ANTONIO

I saw him not.


BEATRICE

How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see
him but I am heart-burned an hour after.


HERO

He is of a very melancholy disposition.


BEATRICE

He were an excellent man that were made just in the
midway between him and Benedick: the one is too
like an image and says nothing, and the other too
like my lady's eldest son, evermore tattling.


LEONATO

Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's
mouth, and half Count John's melancholy in Signior
Benedick's face,--


BEATRICE

With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money
enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman
in the world, if a' could get her good-will.


LEONATO

By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a
husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.


ANTONIO

In faith, she's too curst.


BEATRICE

Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God's
sending that way; for it is said, 'God sends a curst
cow short horns;' but to a cow too curst he sends none.


LEONATO

So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.


BEATRICE

Just, if he send me no husband; for the which
blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and
evening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with a
beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.


LEONATO

You may light on a husband that hath no beard.


BEATRICE

What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel
and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a
beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no
beard is less than a man: and he that is more than
a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a
man, I am not for him: therefore, I will even take
sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his
apes into hell.


LEONATO

Well, then, go you into hell?


BEATRICE

No, but to the gate; and there will the devil meet
me, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, and
say 'Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to
heaven; here's no place for you maids:' so deliver
I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the
heavens; he shows me where the bachelors sit, and
there live we as merry as the day is long.


ANTONIO

[To HERO]  Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled
by your father.


BEATRICE

Yes, faith; it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy
and say 'Father, as it please you.' But yet for all
that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else
make another curtsy and say 'Father, as it please
me.'


LEONATO

Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.


BEATRICE

Not till God make men of some other metal than
earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be
overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust? to make
an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?
No, uncle, I'll none: Adam's sons are my brethren;
and, truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.


LEONATO

Daughter, remember what I told you: if the prince
do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.


BEATRICE

The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be
not wooed in good time: if the prince be too
important, tell him there is measure in every thing
and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero:
wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig,
a measure, and a cinque pace: the first suit is hot
and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as
fantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a
measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes
repentance and, with his bad legs, falls into the
cinque pace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.


LEONATO

Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.


BEATRICE

I have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church by daylight.


LEONATO

The revellers are entering, brother: make good room.
All put on their masks
Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, BALTHASAR, DON JOHN, BORACHIO, MARGARET, URSULA and others, masked


DON PEDRO

Lady, will you walk about with your friend?


HERO

So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing,
I am yours for the walk; and especially when I walk away.


DON PEDRO

With me in your company?


HERO

I may say so, when I please.


DON PEDRO

And when please you to say so?


HERO

When I like your favour; for God defend the lute
should be like the case!


DON PEDRO

My visor is Philemon's roof; within the house is Jove.


HERO

Why, then, your visor should be thatched.


DON PEDRO

Speak low, if you speak love.
Drawing her aside


BALTHASAR

Well, I would you did like me.


MARGARET

So would not I, for your own sake; for I have many
ill-qualities.


BALTHASAR

Which is one?


MARGARET

I say my prayers aloud.


BALTHASAR

I love you the better: the hearers may cry, Amen.


MARGARET

God match me with a good dancer!


BALTHASAR

Amen.


MARGARET

And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is
done! Answer, clerk.


BALTHASAR

No more words: the clerk is answered.


URSULA

I know you well enough; you are Signior Antonio.


ANTONIO

At a word, I am not.


URSULA

I know you by the waggling of your head.


ANTONIO

To tell you true, I counterfeit him.


URSULA

You could never do him so ill-well, unless you were
the very man. Here's his dry hand up and down: you
are he, you are he.


ANTONIO

At a word, I am not.


URSULA

Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your
excellent wit? can virtue hide itself? Go to,
mum, you are he: graces will appear, and there's an
end.


BEATRICE

Will you not tell me who told you so?


BENEDICK

No, you shall pardon me.


BEATRICE

Nor will you not tell me who you are?


BENEDICK

Not now.


BEATRICE

That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit
out of the 'Hundred Merry Tales:'--well this was
Signior Benedick that said so.


BENEDICK

What's he?


BEATRICE

I am sure you know him well enough.


BENEDICK

Not I, believe me.


BEATRICE

Did he never make you laugh?


BENEDICK

I pray you, what is he?


BEATRICE

Why, he is the prince's jester: a very dull fool;
only his gift is in devising impossible slanders:
none but libertines delight in him; and the
commendation is not in his wit, but in his villany;
for he both pleases men and angers them, and then
they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in
the fleet: I would he had boarded me.


BENEDICK

When I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say.


BEATRICE

Do, do: he'll but break a comparison or two on me;
which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at,
strikes him into melancholy; and then there's a
partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no
supper that night.
Music
We must follow the leaders.


BENEDICK

In every good thing.


BEATRICE

Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at
the next turning.
Dance. Then exeunt all except DON JOHN, BORACHIO, and CLAUDIO


DON JOHN

Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath
withdrawn her father to break with him about it.
The ladies follow her and but one visor remains.


BORACHIO

And that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.


DON JOHN

Are not you Signior Benedick?


CLAUDIO

You know me well; I am he.


DON JOHN

Signior, you are very near my brother in his love:
he is enamoured on Hero; I pray you, dissuade him
from her: she is no equal for his birth: you may
do the part of an honest man in it.


CLAUDIO

How know you he loves her?


DON JOHN

I heard him swear his affection.


BORACHIO

So did I too; and he swore he would marry her to-night.


DON JOHN

Come, let us to the banquet.
Exeunt DON JOHN and BORACHIO


CLAUDIO

Thus answer I in the name of Benedick,
But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.
'Tis certain so; the prince wooes for himself.
Friendship is constant in all other things
Save in the office and affairs of love:
Therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues;
Let every eye negotiate for itself
And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch
Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.
This is an accident of hourly proof,
Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero!
Re-enter BENEDICK


BENEDICK

Count Claudio?


CLAUDIO

Yea, the same.


BENEDICK

Come, will you go with me?


CLAUDIO

Whither?


BENEDICK

Even to the next willow, about your own business,
county. What fashion will you wear the garland of?
about your neck, like an usurer's chain? or under
your arm, like a lieutenant's scarf? You must wear
it one way, for the prince hath got your Hero.


CLAUDIO

I wish him joy of her.


BENEDICK

Why, that's spoken like an honest drovier: so they
sell bullocks. But did you think the prince would
have served you thus?


CLAUDIO

I pray you, leave me.


BENEDICK

Ho! now you strike like the blind man: 'twas the
boy that stole your meat, and you'll beat the post.


CLAUDIO

If it will not be, I'll leave you.
Exit


BENEDICK

Alas, poor hurt fowl! now will he creep into sedges.
But that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not
know me! The prince's fool! Ha? It may be I go
under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I
am apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it
is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice
that puts the world into her person and so gives me
out. Well, I'll be revenged as I may.
Re-enter DON PEDRO


DON PEDRO

Now, signior, where's the count? did you see him?


BENEDICK

Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame.
I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a
warren: I told him, and I think I told him true,
that your grace had got the good will of this young
lady; and I offered him my company to a willow-tree,
either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or
to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.


DON PEDRO

To be whipped! What's his fault?


BENEDICK

The flat transgression of a schoolboy, who, being
overjoyed with finding a birds' nest, shows it his
companion, and he steals it.


DON PEDRO

Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The
transgression is in the stealer.


BENEDICK

Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made,
and the garland too; for the garland he might have
worn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed on
you, who, as I take it, have stolen his birds' nest.


DON PEDRO

I will but teach them to sing, and restore them to
the owner.


BENEDICK

If their singing answer your saying, by my faith,
you say honestly.


DON PEDRO

The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: the
gentleman that danced with her told her she is much
wronged by you.


BENEDICK

O, she misused me past the endurance of a block!
an oak but with one green leaf on it would have
answered her; my very visor began to assume life and
scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been
myself, that I was the prince's jester, that I was
duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest
with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood
like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at
me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs:
if her breath were as terrible as her terminations,
there were no living near her; she would infect to
the north star. I would not marry her, though she
were endowed with all that Adam bad left him before
he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have
turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make
the fire too. Come, talk not of her: you shall find
her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God
some scholar would conjure her; for certainly, while
she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a
sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose, because they
would go thither; so, indeed, all disquiet, horror
and perturbation follows her.


DON PEDRO

Look, here she comes.
Enter CLAUDIO, BEATRICE, HERO, and LEONATO


BENEDICK

Will your grace command me any service to the
world's end? I will go on the slightest errand now
to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on;
I will fetch you a tooth-picker now from the
furthest inch of Asia, bring you the length of
Prester John's foot, fetch you a hair off the great
Cham's beard, do you any embassage to the Pigmies,
rather than hold three words' conference with this
harpy. You have no employment for me?


DON PEDRO

None, but to desire your good company.


BENEDICK

O God, sir, here's a dish I love not: I cannot
endure my Lady Tongue.
Exit


DON PEDRO

Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of
Signior Benedick.


BEATRICE

Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave
him use for it, a double heart for his single one:
marry, once before he won it of me with false dice,
therefore your grace may well say I have lost it.


DON PEDRO

You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.


BEATRICE

So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I
should prove the mother of fools. I have brought
Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.


DON PEDRO

Why, how now, count! wherefore are you sad?


CLAUDIO

Not sad, my lord.


DON PEDRO

How then? sick?


CLAUDIO

Neither, my lord.


BEATRICE

The count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor
well; but civil count, civil as an orange, and
something of that jealous complexion.


DON PEDRO

I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true;
though, I'll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is
false. Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and
fair Hero is won: I have broke with her father,
and his good will obtained: name the day of
marriage, and God give thee joy!


LEONATO

Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my
fortunes: his grace hath made the match, and an
grace say Amen to it.


BEATRICE

Speak, count, 'tis your cue.


CLAUDIO

Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were
but little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, as
you are mine, I am yours: I give away myself for
you and dote upon the exchange.


BEATRICE

Speak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouth
with a kiss, and let not him speak neither.


DON PEDRO

In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.


BEATRICE

Yea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on
the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his
ear that he is in her heart.


CLAUDIO

And so she doth, cousin.


BEATRICE

Good Lord, for alliance! Thus goes every one to the
world but I, and I am sunburnt; I may sit in a
corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!


DON PEDRO

Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.


BEATRICE

I would rather have one of your father's getting.
Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Your
father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.


DON PEDRO

Will you have me, lady?


BEATRICE

No, my lord, unless I might have another for
working-days: your grace is too costly to wear
every day. But, I beseech your grace, pardon me: I
was born to speak all mirth and no matter.


DON PEDRO

Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best
becomes you; for, out of question, you were born in
a merry hour.


BEATRICE

No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there
was a star danced, and under that was I born.
Cousins, God give you joy!


LEONATO

Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?


BEATRICE

I cry you mercy, uncle. By your grace's pardon.
Exit


DON PEDRO

By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.


LEONATO

There's little of the melancholy element in her, my
lord: she is never sad but when she sleeps, and
not ever sad then; for I have heard my daughter say,
she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked
herself with laughing.


DON PEDRO

She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.


LEONATO

O, by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit.


DON PEDRO

She were an excellent wife for Benedict.
